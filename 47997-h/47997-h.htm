      CHAPTER I. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>es, I hate
      soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't help writing it&mdash;it relieves my mind. All morning have we
      been driving about that horrid region into which our beautiful, desolate
      moor has been transmogrified; round and round, up and down, in at the
      south camp and out at the north camp; directed hither and thither by
      muddle-headed privates; stared at by puppyish young officers; choked with
      chimney-smoke; jolted over roads laid with ashes&mdash;or no roads at all&mdash;and
      pestered everywhere with the sight of lounging, lazy, red groups,&mdash;that
      color is becoming to me a perfect eye-sore! What a treat it is to get home
      and lock myself&mdash;in my own room&mdash;the tiniest and safest nook in
      all Rockmount&mdash;and spurt out my wrath in the blackest of ink with the
      boldest of pens. Bless you! (query, who can I be blessing, for nobody will
      ever read this), what does it matter? And after all, I repeat, it relieves
      my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do hate soldiers. I always did, from my youth up, till the war in the
      East startled everybody like a thunder-clap. What a time it was&mdash;this
      time two years ago! How the actual romance of each day, as set down in the
      newspapers, made my old romances read like mere balderdash: how the
      present, in its infinite piteousness, its tangible horror, and the
      awfulness of what they called its &ldquo;glory&rdquo; cast the tame past altogether
      into shade! Who read history then, or novels, or poetry? Who read anything
      but that fearful &ldquo;Times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now it is all gone by we have peace again; and this 20th of September,
      1856, I begin with my birthday a new journal&mdash;(capital one, too, with
      a first-rate lock and key, saved out of my summer bonnet, which I didn't
      buy). Nor need I spoil the day&mdash;as once&mdash;by crying over those
      who, two years since,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;Went up
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Red Alma's heights to glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscience, tender over dead heroes, feels not the smallest compunction in
      writing the angry initiatory line, when she thinks of that odious camp
      which has been established near us, for the education of the military
      mind, and the hardening of the military body. Whence red-coats swarm out
      over the pretty neighbourhood like lady-birds over the hop-gardens,&mdash;harmless,
      it is true, yet for ever flying in one's face in the most unpleasant
      manner, making inroads through one's parlour windows, and crawling over
      one's tea-table. Wretched red insects! except that the act would be
      murder, I often wish I could put half-a-dozen of them, swords, epaulets,
      moustaches, and all, under the heel of my shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this is obstinacy, or the love of contradiction. No wonder. Do I
      hear of anything, but soldiers from morning till night? At visits or
      dinner parties can I speak to a soul&mdash;and 'tisn't much I do speak to
      anybody&mdash;but that <i>she</i>&mdash;I use the pronoun advisedly&mdash;is
      sure to bring in with her second sentence something about &ldquo;the camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I'm sick of the camp. Would that my sisters were! For Lisabel, young and
      handsome, there is some excuse, but Penelope&mdash;she ought to know
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa is determined to go with us to the Grantons' ball to-night. I wish
      there were no necessity for it; and have suggested as strongly as I could
      that we should stay at home. But what of that? Nobody minds me. Nobody
      ever did that I ever remember. So poor papa is to be dragged out from his
      cosy arm-chair, jogged and tumbled across these wintry moors, and stuck up
      solemn in a corner of the drawing-room&mdash;being kept carefully out of
      the card-room because he happens to be a clergyman. And all the while he
      will wear his politest and most immovable of smiles, just as if he liked
      it. Oh, why cannot people say what they mean and do as they wish! Why must
      they hold themselves tied and bound with horrible chains of etiquette even
      at the age of seventy! Why cannot he say, &ldquo;Girls&rdquo;&mdash;no, of course he
      would say &ldquo;young ladies&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I had far rather stay at home&mdash;go you
      and enjoy yourselves;&rdquo; or better still, &ldquo;go, two of you&mdash;but I want
      Dora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, he never will say that. He never did want any of us much; me less than
      any. I am neither eldest nor youngest, neither Miss Johnston nor Miss
      Lisabel&mdash;only Miss Dora&mdash;Theodora&mdash;&ldquo;the gift of God,&rdquo; as my
      little bit of Greek taught me. A gift&mdash;what for, and to whom? I
      declare, since I was a baby, since I was a little solitary ugly child,
      wondering if ever I had a mother like other children, since even I have
      been a woman grown, I never have been able to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suppose it is no use to try to alter things. Papa will go his own
      way, and the girls theirs. They think the grand climax of existence is
      &ldquo;society;&rdquo; he thinks the same&mdash;at least for young women, properly
      introduced, escorted and protected there. So, as the three Misses Johnston&mdash;sweet
      fluttering doves!&mdash;have no other chaperon, or protector, he makes a
      martyr of himself on the shrine of paternal duty, <i>alias</i>
      respectability, and goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls here called me down to admire them. Yes, they looked extremely
      well:&mdash;Lisabel, majestic, slow and fair; I doubt if anything in this
      world would disturb the equanimity of her sleepy blue eyes and
      soft-tempered mouth&mdash;a large, mild, beautiful animal, like a white
      Brahmin cow. Very much admired is our Lisabel, and no wonder. That white
      barége will kill half the officers in the camp. She was going to put on
      her pink one, but I suggested how ill pink would look against scarlet; and
      so, after a series of titters, Miss Lisa took my advice. She is evidently
      bent upon looking her best to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope, also; but I wish Penelope would not wear such airy dresses, and
      such a quantity of artificial flowers, while her curls are so thin, and
      her cheeks so sharp. She used to have very pretty hair, ten years ago. I
      remember being exceedingly shocked and fierce about a curl of hers that I
      saw stolen in the summer-house, by Francis Charteris, before we found out
      that they were engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rather expected him to-night, I fancy. Mrs. Granton was sure to have
      invited him with us; but, of course, he has not come. He never did come,
      in my recollection, when he said he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to go and dress; but I can do it in ten minutes, and it is not
      worth while wasting more time. Those two girls&mdash;what a capital foil
      each makes to the other! little, dark, lively&mdash;not to say satirical:
      large, amiable, and fair. Papa ought to be proud of them;&mdash;I suppose
      he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heigho! 'Tis a good thing to be good-looking. And next best, perhaps, is
      downright ugliness,&mdash;nice, interesting, attractive ugliness&mdash;such
      as I have seen in some women: nay, I have somewhere read that ugly women
      have often been loved best.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to be just ordinary; of ordinary height, ordinary figure, and, oh me!
      let me lift up my head from the desk to the looking-glass, and take a good
      stare at an undeniably ordinary face. 'Tis not pleasant. Well; I am as I
      was made; let me not undervalue myself, if only out of reverence for Him
      who made me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely&mdash;Captain Treherne's voice below: Does that young man expect to
      be taken to the ball in our fly? Truly he is making himself one of the
      family, already. There is papa calling us. What will papa say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, he said nothing; and Lisabel, as she swept slowly down the staircase
      with a little silver lamp in her right hand, likewise said nothing; but
      she looked&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody is lovely to somebody,&rdquo; says the proverb. Query, if somebody I
      could name should live to the age of Methuselah, will <i>she</i> ever be
      lovely to anybody?
    </p>
    <p>
      What nonsense! Bravo! thou wert in the right of it, jolly miller of Dee!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;I care for nobody, no, not I;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And nobody cares for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So, let me lock up my desk, and dress for the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, not a bad ball; even now&mdash;when looked at in the light of next
      day's quiet&mdash;with the leaves stirring lazily in the fir-tree by my
      window, and the broad sunshine brightening the moorlands far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a bad ball, even to me, who usually am stoically contemptuous of such
      senseless amusements. Doubtless, from the mean motive that I like dancing,
      and am rarely asked to dance; that I am just five-and-twenty, and get no
      more attention than if I were five-and-forty. Of course, I protest
      continually that I don't care a pin for this fact (mem. mean again). For I
      do care&mdash;at the very bottom of my heart, I do. Many a time have I
      leaned my head here&mdash;good old desk, you will tell no tales!&mdash;and
      cried, actually cried&mdash;with the pain of being neither pretty,
      agreeable, nor young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moralists say, it is in every woman's power to be, in measure, all three:
      that when she is not liked or admired&mdash;by some few at least&mdash;it
      is a sign that she is neither likeable nor admirable. Therefore, I suppose
      I am neither. Probably very disagreeable. Penelope often says so, in her
      sharp, and Lisabel in her lazy way. Lis would apply the same expression to
      a gnat on her wrist, or a dagger pointed at her heart. A &ldquo;thoroughly
      amiable woman!&rdquo; Now I never was&mdash;never shall be&mdash;an amiable
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the ball&mdash;and really I would not mind returning to it
      and having it all over again, which is more than one can say of many hours
      in our lives, especially of those which roll on, rapidly as hours seem to
      roll, after five-and-twenty. It was exceedingly amusing. Large, well-lit
      rooms, filled with well-dressed people; we do not often make such a goodly
      show in our country entertainments; but then the Grantons know everybody,
      and invite everybody. Nobody could do that but dear old Mrs. Granton, and
      &ldquo;my Colin,&rdquo; who, if he has not three pennyworth of brains, has the kindest
      heart and the heaviest purse in the whole neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure Mrs. Granton must have felt proud of her handsome suite of
      rooms, quite a perambulatory parterre, boasting all the hues of the
      rainbow, subdued by the proper complement of inevitable black. By and by,
      as the evening advanced, dot after dot of the adored scarlet made its
      appearance round the doors, and circulating gradually round the room,
      completed the coloring of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were most effective when viewed at a distance&mdash;these scarlet
      dots. Some of them were very young and very small: wore their short hair&mdash;regulation
      cut&mdash;exceedingly straight, and did not seem quite comfortable in
      their clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Militia, of course,&rdquo; I overheard a lady observe, who apparently knew all
      about it. &ldquo;None of our officers wear uniform when they can avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But these young lads seemed uncommonly proud of theirs, and strutted and
      sidled about the door, very valorous and magnificent, until caught and
      dragged to their destiny&mdash;in the shape of some fair partner&mdash;when
      they immediately relapsed into shyness and awkwardness. Nay, I might add&mdash;stupidity;
      but were they not the hopeful defenders of their country, and did not
      their noble swords lie idle at this moment on that safest resting-place&mdash;Mrs.
      Granton's billiard-table?
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched the scene out of my corner, in a state of dreamy amusement;
      mingled with a vague curiosity as to how long I should be left to sit
      solitary there, and whether it would be very dull, if &ldquo;with gazing fed&rdquo;&mdash;including
      a trifle of supper&mdash;I thus had to spend the entire evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Granton came bustling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl&mdash;are you not dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently not,&rdquo; said I, laughing, and trying to catch her, and make room
      for her. Vain attempt! Mrs. Granton never will sit down while there is
      anything that she thinks can be done for anybody. In a moment she would
      have been buzzing all round the room like an amiable bee, in search of
      some unfortunate youth upon whom to inflict me as a partner&mdash;but not
      even my desire of dancing would allow me to sink so low as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      For safety, I ran after, and attacked the good old lady on one of her weak
      points. Luckily she caught the bait, and we were soon safely landed on the
      great blanket, beef, and anti-beer distribution question, now shaking our
      parish to its very foundations. I am ashamed to say, though the rector's
      daughter, it is very little I know about our parish. And though at first I
      rather repented of my <i>ruse</i>, seeing that Mrs. Granton's deafness
      made both her remarks and my answers most unpleasantly public, gradually I
      became so interested in what she was telling me, that we must have kept on
      talking nearly twenty minutes, when some one called the old lady away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to leave you, Miss Dora, but I leave you in good company,&rdquo; she
      said, nodding and smiling to some people behind the sofa, with whom she
      probably thought I was acquainted. But I was not, nor had the slightest
      ambition for that honour. Strangers at a ball have rarely anything to say
      worth saying or hearing. So I never turned my head, and let Mrs. Granton
      trot away.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mind and eyes followed her with a half sigh; considering whether at
      sixty I shall have half the activity, or cheerfulness, or kindliness, of
      her dear old self.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one broke in upon my meditations. Papa's white head was visible in a
      distant doorway; for the girls, they had long since vanished in the
      whirligig. I caught at times a glimpse of Penelope's rose-clouds of
      tarlatan, her pale, face, and ever-smiling white teeth, that contrast ill
      with her restless black eyes&mdash;it is always rather painful to me to
      watch my eldest sister at parties. And now and then Miss Lisabel came
      floating, moon-like, through the room, almost obscuring young slender
      Captain Treherne, who yet appeared quite content in his occultation. He
      also seemed to be of my opinion that scarlet and white were the best
      mixture of colours, for I did not see him make the slightest attempt to
      dance with any lady but Lisabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several people, I noticed, looked at them and smiled. And one lady
      whispered something about &ldquo;poor clergyman's daughter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sir William
      Treherne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt hot to my very temples. Oh, if we were all in Paradise, or a
      nunnery, or some place where there was neither thinking nor making of
      marriages!
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined to catch Lisa when the waltz was done. She waltzes well, even
      gracefully, for a tall woman&mdash;but I wished, I wished&mdash;My wish
      was cut short by a collision which made me start up with an idea of
      rushing to the rescue; however, the next moment Treherne and she had
      recovered their balance and were spinning on again. Of course I sat down
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my looks must be terrible tell-tales; for some one behind me said, as
      plain as if in answer to my thoughts:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray be satisfied; the lady could not have been in the least hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised; for though the voice was polite, even kind, people do
      not, at least in our country society, address one another without an
      introduction. I answered civilly, of course, but it must have been with
      some stiffness of manner, for the gentleman said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me; I concluded it was your sister who slipped, and that you were
      uneasy about her,&rdquo; bowed, and immediately moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt uncomfortable; uncertain whether to take any more notice of him or
      not; wondering who it was that had used the unwonted liberty of speaking
      to me&mdash;a stranger&mdash;and whether it would have been committing
      myself in any way to venture more than a bow or a &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last common-sense settled the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora Johnston,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;do not be a simpleton. Do you consider
      yourself so much better than your fellow creatures that you hesitate at
      returning a civil answer to a civil remark&mdash;meant kindly, too&mdash;because
      you, forsooth, like the French gentleman who was entreated to save another
      gentleman from drowning&mdash;'should have been most happy, but have never
      been introduced.'&mdash;What, girl, is this your scorn of conventionality&mdash;your
      grand habit of thinking and judging for yourself&mdash;your noble
      independence of all the follies of society? Fie! fie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To punish myself for my cowardice, I determined to turn round and look at
      the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punishment was not severe. He had a good face, brown and dark: a thin,
      spare, wiry figure, an air somewhat formal. His eyes were grave, yet not
      without a lurking spirit of humour, which seemed to have clearly
      penetrated, and been rather amused by, my foolish embarrassment and
      ridiculous indecision. This vexed me for the moment: then I smiled&mdash;we
      both smiled: and began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it would have been different had he been a young man; but he
      was not. I should think he was nearly forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mrs. Granton came up, with her usual pleased look when she
      thinks other people are pleased with one another, and said in that
      friendly manner that makes everybody else feel friendly together also:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A partner, I see. That's right, Miss Dora. You shall have a quadrille in
      a minute, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor! I felt relieved. He might have been worse&mdash;perhaps, from his
      beard, even a camp officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend takes things too much for granted,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;I
      believe I must introduce myself. My name is Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the quadrille began to form, and I to button my gloves not
      discontentedly. He said:&mdash;&ldquo;I fear I am assuming a right on false
      pretences, for I never danced, in my life. You do, I see. I must not
      detain you from another partner.&rdquo; And, once again, my unknown friend, who
      seemed to have such extreme penetration into my motives and intentions,
      moved aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I got no partner&mdash;I never do. When the doctor re-appeared,
      I was unfeignedly glad to see him. He took no notice whatever of my
      humiliating state of solitude, but sat down in one of the dancers' vacated
      places, and resumed the thread of our conversation, as if it had never
      been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often in a crowd, two people not much interested therein, fall upon
      subjects perfectly extraneous, which at once make them feel interested in
      these and in each other. Thus, it seems quite odd this morning to think of
      the multiplicity of heterogeneous topics which Dr. Urquhart discussed last
      night. I gained from him much various information. He must have been a
      great traveller, and observer too; and for me, I marvel now to recollect
      how freely I spoke my mind on many things which I usually keep to myself,
      partly from shyness, partly because nobody here at home cares one straw
      about them. Among others, came the universal theme,&mdash;the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, I thought the three much laughed-at Quakers, who went to advise
      peace to the Czar Nicholas, were much nearer the truth than many of their
      mockers. War seemed to me so utterly opposed to Christianity that I did
      not see how any Christian man could ever become a soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Doctor Urquhart leant his elbow on the arm of the sofa, and
      looked me steadily in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that a Christian man is not to defend his own life or
      liberty, or that of others, under any circumstances?&mdash;or is he to
      wear a red coat peacefully while peace lasts, and at his first battle
      throw down his musket, shoulder his Testament, and walk away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, though of a freer tone than I was used to, were not spoken in
      any irreverence. They puzzled me. I felt as if I had been playing the
      oracle upon a subject whereon I had not the least grounds to form an
      opinion at all. Yet I would not yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Urquhart, if you recollect, I said '<i>become</i> a soldier.' How,
      being already a soldier, a Christian man should act, I am not wise enough
      to judge. But I do think, other professions being open, for him to choose
      voluntarily the profession of arms, and to receive wages for taking away
      life, is at best a monstrous anomaly. Nay, however it may be glossed over
      and refined away, surely, in face of the plain command, '<i>Thou shall not
      kill</i>,' military glory seems little better than a picturesque form of
      murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke strongly&mdash;more strongly, perhaps, than a young woman, whose
      opinions are more instincts and emotions than matured principles, ought to
      speak. If so, Doctor Urquhart gave me a fitting rebuke by his total
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he, for some time, even so much as look at me, but bent his head
      down till I could only catch the fore-shortened profile of forehead, nose,
      and curly beard. Certainly, though a moustache is mean, puppyish,
      intolerable, and whiskers not much better, there is something fine and
      manly in a regular Oriental beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart spoke at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, as I overheard you say to Mrs. Granton, you 'hate soldiers.' 'Hate'
      is a strong word&mdash;for a Christian woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My own weapons turned upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hate soldiers because my principles, instincts, observations,
      confirm me in the justice of my dislike. In peace, they are idle, useless,
      extravagant, cumberers of the country&mdash;the mere butterflies of
      society. In war&mdash;you know what they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew rather angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, had I ever had a spark of military ardour, it would have been
      quenched within the last year. I never see a thing&mdash;we'll not say a
      man&mdash;with a red coat on, who does not make himself thoroughly
      contempt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word stuck in the middle. For lo! there passed slowly by, my sister
      Lisabel; leaning on the arm of Captain Treherne, looking as I never saw
      Lisabel look before. It suddenly rushed across me what might happen&mdash;perhaps
      had happened. Suppose, in thus passionately venting my prejudices, I
      should be tacitly condemning my&mdash;what an odd idea!&mdash;my
      brother-in-law? Pride, if no better feeling, caused me to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquart said, quietly enough, &ldquo;I should tell you&mdash;indeed I
      ought to have told you before&mdash;that I am myself in the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am sure I looked&mdash;as I felt&mdash;like a downright fool. This
      comes, I thought, of speaking one's mind, especially to strangers. Oh!
      should I ever learn to hold my tongue, or gabble pretty harmless nonsense
      as other girls? Why should I have talked seriously to this man at all? I
      knew nothing of him, and had no business to be interested in him, or even
      to have listened to him&mdash;my sister would say,&mdash;until he had been
      &ldquo;properly introduced;&rdquo;&mdash;until I knew where he lived, and who were his
      father and mother, and what was his profession, and how much income he had
      a-year?
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I did feel interested, and could not help it. Something it seemed
      that I was bound to say; I wished it to be civil, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are Doctor Urquhart. An army-surgeon is scarcely like a soldier:
      his business is to save life rather than to destroy it. Surely <i>you</i>
      never could have killed anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment I had put the question, I saw how childish and uncalled-for, in
      fact, how actually impertinent it was. Covered with confusion, I drew
      back, and looked another way. It was the greatest relief imaginable when
      just then Lisabel saw me, and came up with Captain Treherne, all smiles,
      to say, was it not the pleasantest party imaginable? and who had I been
      dancing with?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I saw you myself, talking to some strange gentleman. Who was he? A
      rather odd-looking person, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, please. It was a Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Urquhart of ours?&rdquo; cried young Treherne. &ldquo;Why, he told me he should not
      come, or should not stay ten minutes if he came. Much too solid for this
      kind of thing&mdash;eh, you see? Yet a capital fellow. The best fellow in
      all the world. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;best fellow in all the world&rdquo; had entirely disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed the rest of the evening extremely,&mdash;that is, pretty well.
      Not altogether, now I come to think of it, for though I danced to my
      heart's content, Captain Treherne seeming eager to bring up his whole
      regiment, successively, for my patronage and Penelope's (N.B. <i>not</i>
      Lisabel's), whenever I caught a distant glimpse of Dr. Urquhart's brown
      beard, conscience stung me for my folly and want of tact. Dear me! What a
      thing it is that one can so seldom utter an honest opinion without
      offending somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he really offended? He must have seen that I did not mean any harm;
      nor does he look like one of those touchy people who are always wincing as
      if they trod on the tails of imaginary adders. Yet he made no attempt to
      come and talk to me again; for which I was sorry; partly because I would
      have liked to make him some amends, and partly because he seemed the only
      man present worth talking to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do wonder more and more what my sisters can find in the young men they
      dance and chatter with. To me they are inane, conceited, absolutely
      unendurable. Yet there may be good in some of them. May? Nay, there <i>must</i>
      be good in every human being. Alas, me! Well might Dr. Urquhart say last
      night that there are no judgments so harsh as those of the erring, the
      inexperienced, and the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to add, that when we were wearily waiting for our fly to draw up
      to the hall-door, Dr. Urquhart suddenly appeared. Papa had Penelope on his
      arm, Lisabel was whispering with Captain Treherne. Yes, depend upon it,
      that young man will be my brother-in-law. I stood by myself in the
      doorway, looking out on the pitch-dark night, when some one behind me
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray stand within shelter. You young ladies are never half careful enough
      of your health. Allow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a grave professional air, my medical friend wrapped me closely up
      in my shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plaid, I see. That is sensible. There is nothing for warmth like a good
      plaid,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, which, even had it not been for his name,
      and a slight strengthening and broadening of his English, scarcely
      amounting to an accent, would have pretty well showed what part of the
      kingdom Dr. Urquhart came from. I was going, in my bluntness, to put the
      direct question, but felt as if I had committed myself quite enough for
      one night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then was shouted out &ldquo;Mr. Johnson's,&rdquo;&mdash;(oh dear, shall we never
      get the aristocratic 't' into our plebeian name!)&mdash;&ldquo;carriage,&rdquo; and I was
      hurried into the fly. Not by the Doctor, though; he stood like a bear on
      the doorstep, and never attempted to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all.

      &mdash;Private William Carter, æt. 24; admitted a week to-day. Gastric
      fever&mdash;typhoid form&mdash;slight delirium&mdash;bad case. Asked me to

      Corporal Thomas Hardman, æt. 50&mdash;Delirium tremens&mdash;mending. Knew
      him in the Crimea, when he was a perfectly sober fellow, with constitution

      to send for him after his discharge from hospital, and see what can be

      M. U.&mdash;Max Urquhart.&mdash;Max Urquhart, M.D., M.R.C.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Who keeps scribbling his name up and down this page like a silly
      school-boy, just for want of something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something to do! Never for these twenty years and more have I been so
      totally without occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a place this camp is! worse than ours in the Crimea, by far. To-day
      especially. Rain pouring, wind howling, mud ancle-deep; nothing on earth
      for me to be, to do, or to suffer, except&mdash;yes! there is something to
      suffer&mdash;Treherne's eternal flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith, I must be very hard up for occupation when I thus continue this
      journal of my cases into a personal diary of the worst patient I have to
      deal with&mdash;the most thankless, unsatisfactory, and unkindly.
      Physician, heal thyself! But how?
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall tear out this page,&mdash;or stay, I'll keep it as a remarkable
      literary and psychological fact&mdash;and go on with my article on Gunshot
      Wounds.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the which, two hours after, I find, I have written exactly ten lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      These must be the sort of circumstances under which people commit
      journals. For some do&mdash;and heartily as I have always contemned the
      proceeding, as we are prone to contemn peculiarities and idiosyncrasies
      quite foreign to our own,&mdash;I begin to-day dimly to understand the
      state of mind in which such a thing might be possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diary of a Physician&rdquo; shall I call it?&mdash;did not some one write a
      book with that title? I picked it up on ship-board&mdash;a story-book or
      some such thing&mdash;but I scarcely ever read what is called &ldquo;light
      literature.&rdquo; I have never had time. Besides, all fictions grow tame,
      compared to the realities of daily life, the horrible episodes of crime,
      the pitiful bits of hopeless misery that I meet with in my profession.
      Talk of romance!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I ever romantic? Once perhaps. Or at least I might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      My profession, truly there is nothing like it for me. Therein I find
      incessant work, interest, hope. Daily do I thank heaven that I had courage
      to seize on it and go through with it, in order&mdash;according to the
      phrase I heard used last night&mdash;&ldquo;to save life instead of destroying
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor little girl&mdash;she meant nothing&mdash;she had no idea what she
      was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it that which makes me so unsettled today?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it would be wiser never to go into society. A hospital-ward is far
      more natural to me than a ball-room. There, is work to be done, pain to be
      alleviated, evil of all kinds to be met and overcome&mdash;here, nothing
      but pleasure, nothing to do but to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet some people can enjoy; and actually do so; I am sure that girl did.
      Several times during the evening she looked quite happy. I do not often
      see people looking happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is suffering then our normal and natural state? Is to exist synonymous
      with to endure? Can this be the law of a beneficent Providence?&mdash;or
      are such results allowed&mdash;to happen in certain exceptional cases,
      utterly irremediable and irretrievable&mdash;like&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What am I writing?&mdash;What am I daring to write?

    <p>
      <i>Physician, heal thyself.</i> And surely that is one of a physician's
      first duties. A disease struck inwards&mdash;the merest tyro knows how
      fatal is treatment which results in that. It may be I have gone on the
      wrong track altogether,&mdash;at least since my return to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present only is a man's possession: the past is gone out of his hand,&mdash;wholly,
      irrevocably. He may suffer from it, learn from it&mdash;in degree,
      perhaps, expiate it; but to brood over it is utter madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I have had many cases of insanity&mdash;both physical and moral, so
      to speak; I call moral insanity that kind of disease which is
      super-induced on comparatively healthy minds by dwelling incessantly on
      one idea; the sort of disease which you find in women who have fallen into
      melancholy from love-disappointments; or in men for overweening ambition,
      hatred, or egotism&mdash;which latter, carried to a high pitch, invariably
      becomes a kind of insanity. All these forms of monomania, as distinguished
      from physical mania, disease of the structure of the brain, I have studied
      with considerable interest and corresponding success. My secret was simple
      enough; one which Nature herself often tries and rarely fails in&mdash;the
      law of substitution; the slow eradication of any fixed idea, by supplying
      others, under the influence of which the original idea is, at all events
      temporarily, laid to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why cannot I try this plan? why not do for myself what I have so many
      times prescribed and done for others?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with some notion of the kind that I went to this ball&mdash;after
      getting up a vague sort of curiosity in Treherne's anonymous beauty, about
      whom he has so long been raving to me&mdash;boy-like. Ay, with all his
      folly, the lad is an honest lad. I should not like him to come to any
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall one must have been the lady, and the smaller, the plainer, though
      the pleasanter to my mind, was no doubt her sister. And of course her name
      too was <i>Johnson</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a name to startle a man so&mdash;to cause him to stand like a fool at
      that hall-door, with his heart dead still, and all his nerves quivering!
      To make him now, in the mere writing of it, pause and compel himself into
      common sense by rational argument&mdash;by meeting the thing, be it
      chimerical or not, face to face, as a man ought to do. Yet as cowardly, in
      as base a paroxysm of terror, as if likewise face to face, in my hut
      corner, stood&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I stopped. Shortly afterwards I was summoned to the hospital, where I
      have been ever since. William Carter is dead. He will not want his mother
      now. What a small matter life or death seems when one comes to think of
      it. What an easy exchange!
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it I who am writing thus, and on the same leaf which, closed up in
      haste when I was fetched to the hospital, I have just had such an anxious
      search for, that it might be instantly burnt. Yet, I find there is nothing
      in it that I need have feared&mdash;nothing that could, in any way, have
      signified to anybody, unless, perhaps, the writing of that one name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I never get over this absurd folly&mdash;this absolute monomania?&mdash;when
      there are hundreds of the same name to be met with every day&mdash;when,
      after all, it is not exactly <i>the</i> name!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this is what it cost me. Let me write it down, that the confession in
      plain English of such utter insanity may in degree have the same effect as
      when I have sat down and desired a patient to recount to me, one by one,
      each and all of his delusions, in order that, in the mere telling of them,
      they might perhaps vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went away from that hall-door at once. Never asking&mdash;nor do I think
      for my life I could ask, the simple question that would have set all doubt
      at rest. I walked across country, up and down, along road or woodland, I
      hardly knew whither, for miles&mdash;following the moon-rise. She seemed
      to rise just as she did nineteen years ago&mdash;nineteen years, ten
      months, all but two days&mdash;my arithmetic is correct, no fear! She
      lifted herself like a ghost over those long level waves of moor, till she
      sat, blood-red, upon the horizon, with a stare which there was nothing to
      break, nothing to hide from&mdash;nothing between her and me, but the
      plain and the sky&mdash;just as it was that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      What am I writing? Is the old horror coming back again. It cannot. It <i>must</i>
      be kept at bay..
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock&mdash;ah, I see; it is the sergeant of poor Carter's company. I
      must return to daily work, and labour is life&mdash;to me.

      CHAPTER III. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ept. 30th:&mdash;Not
      a case to set down to-day. This high moorland is your best sanatorium. My
      &ldquo;occupation's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have every satisfaction in that fact, or in the cause of it; which,
      cynics might say, a member of my profession would easily manage to
      prevent, were he a city physician instead of a regimental surgeon. Still,
      idleness is insupportable to me. I have tried going about among the few
      villages hard by, but their worst disease is one to which this said
      regimental surgeon, with nothing but his pay, can apply but small remedy&mdash;poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I have paced the long, straight lines of the camp; from the
      hospital to the bridge, and back again to the hospital&mdash;have tried to
      take a vivid interest in the loungers, the foot-ball players, and the
      wretched, awkward squad turned out in never-ending parade. With each hour
      of the quiet autumn afternoon have I watched the sentinel mount the little
      stockaded hillock, and startle the camp with the old familiar boom of the
      great Sebastopol bell. Then, I have shut my hut-door, taken to my books,
      and studied till my head warned me to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening post&mdash;but only business letters. I rarely have any other.
      I have no one to write to me&mdash;no one to write to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I have been driven to wish I had; some one friend with whom it
      would be possible to talk in pen and ink, on other matters than business.
      Yet, <i>cui bono?</i> To no friend should I or could I let out my real
      self; the only thing in the letter that was truly and absolutely me would
      be the great grim signature: &ldquo;Max Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Were it otherwise&mdash;were there any human being to whom I could lay
      open my whole heart, trust with my whole history;&mdash;but no, that were
      utterly impossible now.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more, until the end. That end, which at once solves all difficulties,
      every year brings nearer. Nearly forty, and a doctor's life is usually
      shorter than most men's. I shall be an old man soon, even if there come
      none of those sudden chances against which I have of course provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end. How and in what manner it is to be done, I am not yet clear. But
      it shall be done, before my death or after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max Urquhart, M.D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I go on signing my name mechanically, with those two business-like letters
      after it, and thinking how odd it would be to sign it in any other
      fashion. How strange,&mdash;did any one care to look at my signature in
      any way except thus, with the two professional letters after it&mdash;a
      common-place signature of business. Equally strange, perhaps, that such a
      thought as this last should have entered my head, or that I should have
      taken the trouble, and yielded to the weakness of writing it down. It all
      springs from idleness&mdash;sheer idleness; the very same cause that makes
      Treherne, whom I have known do duty cheerily for twenty-four hours in the
      trenches, lounge, smoke, yawn, and play the flute. There&mdash;it has
      stopped. I heard the postman rapping at his hut-door&mdash;the young
      simpleton has got a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, just to pass away the time, I, Max Urquhart, reduced to this
      lowest ebb of inanity by a paternal government, which has stranded my
      regiment here, high and dry, but as dreary as Noah on Ararat&mdash;were to
      enliven my solitude, drive away blue devils, by manufacturing for myself
      an imaginary correspondent? So be it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin then at once in the received epistolary form:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear&mdash;what? &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;&mdash;No&mdash;not for this once. I wanted a
      change. &ldquo;Madam?&rdquo;&mdash;that is formal. Shall I invent a name?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think of it, how strange it would feel to me to be writing &ldquo;my
      dear&rdquo; before any Christian name. Orphaned early, my only brother long
      dead, drifting about from land to land till I have almost forgotten my
      own, which has quite forgotten me&mdash;I had not considered it before,
      but really I do not believe there is a human being living, whom I have a
      right to call by his or her Christian name, or who would ever think of
      calling me by mine. &ldquo;Max,&rdquo;&mdash;I have not heard the sound of it for
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear</i>, a pleasant adjective&mdash;my, a pronoun of possession,
      implying that the being spoken of is one's very own,&mdash;one's sole,
      sacred, personal property, as with natural selfishness one would wish to
      hold the thing most precious. <i>My dear</i>;&mdash;a satisfactory total.
      I rather object to &ldquo;dearest&rdquo; as a word implying comparison, and therefore
      never to be used where comparison should not and could not exist. Witness,
      &ldquo;dearest mother,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dearest wife,&rdquo; as if a man had a plurality of
      mothers and wives, out of whom he chose the one he loved best. And, as a
      general rule, I dislike all ultra expressions of affection set down in
      ink. I once knew an honest gentleman&mdash;blessed with one of the
      tenderest hearts that ever man had, and which in all his life was only
      given to one woman; he, his wife told me, had never, even in their
      courtship days, written to her otherwise than as &ldquo;My dear Anne,&rdquo;&mdash;ending
      merely with &ldquo;Yours faithfully,&rdquo; or &ldquo;yours truly.&rdquo; Faithful&mdash;true&mdash;what
      could he write, or she desire more?
    </p>
    <p>
      If my pen wanders to lovers and sweethearts, and moralises over simple
      sentences in this maundering way, blame not me, dear imaginary
      correspondent, to whom no name shall be given at all&mdash;but blame my
      friend,&mdash;as friends go in this world,&mdash;Captain Augustus
      Treherne. Because, happily, that young fellow's life was saved at
      Balaclava, does he intend to invest me with the responsibility of it, with
      all its scrapes and follies, now and for evermore? Is my clean, sober hut
      to be fumigated with tobacco and poisoned with brandy-and-water, that a
      lovesick youth may unburden himself of his sentimental tale? Heaven knows
      why I listen to it! Probably because telling me keeps the lad out of
      mischief; also because he is honest, though an ass, and I always had a
      greater leaning to fools than to knaves. But let me not pretend reasons
      which make me out more generous than I really am, for the fellow and his
      love-affair, bore me exceedingly sometimes, and would be quite unendurable
      anywhere but in this dull camp. I do it from a certain abstract pleasure
      which I have always taken in dissecting character, constituting myself an
      amateur demonstrator of spiritual anatomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amusing study is, not only the swain, but the goddess. For I found her
      out, spelled her over satisfactorily, even in that one evening. Treherne
      little guessed it&mdash;he took care never to introduce me&mdash;he does
      not even mention her name, or suspect I know it. Vast precautions against
      nothing! Does he fear lest Mentor should put in a claim to his Eucharis?
      You know better, dear. Imaginary Correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even were I among the list of &ldquo;marrying men,&rdquo; this adorable she would
      never be my choice, would never attract me for an instant. Little as I
      know about women, I know enough to feel certain that there is a very small
      residuum of depth, feeling, or originality, in that large handsome
      physique of hers. Yet she looks good-natured, good-tempered; almost as
      much so as Treherne himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak o' the de'il,&rdquo; there he comes. Far away down the lines I can catch
      his eternal &ldquo;Donna é mobile,&rdquo;&mdash;how I detest that song! No doubt he
      has been taking to the post his answer to one of those abominably-scented
      notes that he always drops out of his waistcoat by the merest accident,
      and glances round to see if I am looking&mdash;which I never am. What a
      young puppy it is! Yet it hangs after one kindly, like a puppy; after me
      too, who am not the pleasantest fellow in the world. And as it is but
      young, it <i>may</i> mend, if it falls into no worse company than the
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have known what it is to be without a friend when one is very
      inexperienced, reckless, and young.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Evening.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what base uses may we come at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems perfectly ridiculous to see the use this memorandum-book has come
      to. Cases forsooth! The few pages of them may as well be torn out, in
      favour of the new specimens of moral disease which I am driven to study.
      For instance:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 1&mdash;Better omit that.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 2&mdash;Augustus Treherne, æt. 22, intermittent fever, verging upon
      yellow fever occasionally, as to-day. Pulse, very high, tongue, rather
      foul, especially in speaking of Mr. Colin Granton. Countenance, pale,
      inclining to livid. A very bad case altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient enters, whistling like a steam-engine, as furious and as shrill,
      with a corresponding puff of smoke. I point to the obnoxious vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Doctor, I always forget. What a tyrant you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but there is one thing I never will allow; smoking in my
      hut. I did not, you know, even in the Crimea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad sat down, sighing like a furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho, Doctor, I wish I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always seem so uncommonly comfortable; never want a cigar or anything
      to quiet your nerves and keep you in good humour. You never get into a
      scrape of any sort; have neither a mother to lecture you, nor an old
      governor to bully you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will then; you need not take me up so sharp. He's a trump, after all.
      You know that, so I don't mind a word or two against him. Just read
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw over one of Sir William's ultraprosy moral essays&mdash;which no
      doubt the worthy old gentleman flatters himself are, in another line, the
      very copy of Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son. I might have smiled
      at it had I been alone,&mdash;or laughed at it were I young enough to
      sympathise with the modern system of transposing into &ldquo;the Governor,&rdquo; the
      ancient reverend name of &ldquo;Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what an opinion he has of you. 'Pon my life, if I were not the
      meekest fellow imaginable, always ready to be led by a straw into Virtue's
      ways, I should have cut your acquaintance long ago. 'Invariably follow the
      advice of Dr. Urquhart,'&mdash;'I wish, my dear son, that your character
      more resembled that of your friend, Dr. Urquhart. I should be more
      concerned about your many follies, were you not in the same regiment as
      Dr. Urquhart. Dr. Urquhart is one of the wisest men I ever knew,' and so
      on, and so on. What say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing; and I now write down this, as I shall write anything of
      the kind which enters into the plain relation of facts or conversations
      which daily occur. God knows how vain such words are to me at the best of
      times&mdash;mere sounding brass and tinkling cymbal&mdash;as the like must
      be to most men well acquainted with themselves. At some times, and under
      certain states of mind, they become to my ear the most refined and
      exquisite torture that my bitterest enemy could desire to inflict. There
      is no need, therefore, to apologise for them. Apologise to whom, indeed?
      Having resolved to write this, it were folly to make it an imperfect
      statement. A journal should be fresh, complete, and correct&mdash;the
      man's entire life, or nothing. Since, if he sets it down at all, it must
      necessarily be for his own sole benefit&mdash;it would be the most
      contemptible form of egotistic humbug to arrange and modify it as if it
      were meant for the eye of any other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear, unknown, imaginary eye&mdash;which never was and never will be&mdash;yet
      which I like to fancy shining somewhere in the clouds, out of Jupiter,
      Venus, or the Georgium Sidus, upon this solitary me&mdash;the foregoing
      sentence bears no reference to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treherne,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;whatever good opinion your father is pleased to hold
      as to my wisdom, I certainly do not share in one juvenile folly&mdash;that,
      being a very well-meaning fellow on the whole, I take the greatest pains
      to make myself out a scamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's me, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wear the cap if it feels comfortable. And now, will you have some tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything&mdash;I feel as thirsty as when you found me dragging myself to
      the brink of the Tchernaya. Hey, Doctor, it would have saved me a deal of
      bother if you had never found me at all. Except that it would vex the old
      governor to end the name and have the property all going to the dogs,&mdash;that
      is, to Cousin Charteris; who would not care how soon I was dead and
      buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Were</i> dead and buried, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, to stop a man about his grammar when he is in my state of
      mind! Kept from his cigar, too! Doctor, you never were in love, or you
      never were a smoker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you never could have given up the one or the other; a fellow
      can't; 'tis an impossibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? I once smoked six cigars a day, for two years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what? And you never let that out before? You are so close! Possibly,
      the other fact will peep out in time Mrs. Urquhart and half-a-dozen brats
      may be living in some out-of-the-way nook&mdash;Cornwall, or Jersey, or
      the centre of Salisbury Plain. Why, what?&mdash;nay, I beg your pardon,
      Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a horrible thing it is that by no physical effort, added to years of
      mental self-control, can I so harden my nerves that certain words, names,
      suggestions, shall not startle me&mdash;make me quiver as if under the
      knife. Doubtless, Treherne will henceforth retain&mdash;so far as his easy
      mind can retain anything&mdash;the idea that I have a wife and family
      hidden somewhere! Ludicrous idea, if it were not connected with other
      ideas from which, however, this one will serve to turn his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      To explain it away was of course impossible. I had only power to slip from
      the subject with a laugh, and bring him back to the tobacco question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I smoked six cigars a-day for at least two years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And gave it up? Wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very, when a man has a will of his own, and a few strong reasons to
      back it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with them&mdash;not that they will benefit me however&mdash;I'm quite
      incorrigible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. First, I was a poor medical student, and six cigars per diem
      cost fourteen shillings a-week,&mdash;thirty-one pounds, eight
      shillings, a-year. A good sum to give for an artificial want&mdash;enough
      to have fed and clothed a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're weak on the point of brats, Urquhart. Do you remember the little
      Russ we picked up in the cellar at Sebastopol? I do believe you'd have
      adopted and brought it home with you if it had not died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Should I? But as Treherne said, it died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secondly, thirty-one pounds, eight shillings per annum was a good deal
      to give for a purely selfish enjoyment, annoying to almost everybody
      except the smoker, and at the time of smoking&mdash;especially when to the
      said smoker it is sure to grow from a mere accidental enjoyment into an
      irresistible necessity&mdash;a habit to which he becomes the most utter
      slave. Now, a man is only half a man who allows himself to become the
      slave of any habit whatsoever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Doctor, all this should go into the <i>Lancet</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for it does not touch the question on the medical side, but the
      general and practical one: namely, that to create an unnecessary luxury,
      which is a nuisance to every body else, and to himself of very doubtful
      benefit&mdash;is&mdash;excuse me&mdash;the very silliest thing a young man
      can do. A thing, which, from my own experience, I'll not aid and abet any
      young man in doing. There, lecture's over, and kettle boiled&mdash;unless
      you prefer tobacco and the open air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not: and we sat down&mdash;&ldquo;four feet upon a fender&rdquo;&mdash;as the
      proverb says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho! but the proverb doesn't mean four feet in men's boots,&rdquo; said
      Treherne, dolefully. &ldquo;I wish I was dead and buried.&rdquo; I suggested that the
      light moustache he curled so fondly, the elegant hair, and the
      aristocratic outline of phiz, would look exceedingly well&mdash;in a
      coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faugh! how unpleasant you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I myself repented the speech: for it ill becomes a man under any
      provocation to make a jest of Death. But, that this young fellow, so full
      of life, with every attraction that it can offer&mdash;health, wealth,
      kindred, friends&mdash;should sit croaking there, with such a used-up,
      lack-a-daisical air,&mdash;truly it irritated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter&mdash;that you wish to rid the world of your valuable
      presence?&mdash;Has the young lady expressed a similar desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She?&mdash;Hang her! I won't think any more about her,&rdquo; said the lad
      sullenly. And then, out poured the grand despair, the unendurable climax
      of mortal woe. &ldquo;She cantered through the north camp this afternoon, with
      Granton&mdash;Colin Granton, and upon Granton's own brown mare.&rdquo;
     </p>

      I stopped&mdash;there seemed more reality in his feelings than I had been
      aware of; and it is scarcely right to make a mock of even the
      fire-and-smoke, dust-and-ashes passion of a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; not knowing the affair had gone so far. Still, it
      isn't worth being dead and buried for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business has she to go riding with that big clod-hopping lout? And
      what right has he to lend her his brown mare?&rdquo; chafed Treherne, with a
      great deal more which I did not much attend to. At last, weary of playing
      Friar Lawrence to such a very uninteresting Romeo, I hinted, that if he
      disapproved of the young lady's behaviour, he ought to appeal to her own
      good sense, to her father, or somebody&mdash;or, since women understand
      one another best, get Lady Augusta Treherne to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother! She never even heard of her. Why, you speak as seriously as if
      I were actually intending to marry her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I could not help rousing myself a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;it never struck me that a gentleman could discuss a young
      lady among his acquaintance, make a public show of his admiration for her,
      interfere with her proceedings or her conduct towards any other gentleman,
      and <i>not</i> intend to marry her. Suppose we choose another subject of
      conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Treherne grew hot to the ears, but he took the hint and spared me his
      sentimental maunderings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had afterwards some interesting conversation about a few cases of mine
      in the neighbourhood, not on the regular list of regimental patients which
      have lately been to me a curious study. If I were inclined to quit the
      army&mdash;I believe the branch of my profession which I should take up
      would be that of sanitary reform&mdash;the study of health rather than of
      disease, of prevention rather than cure. It often seems to me, that we of
      the healing art have began at the wrong end&mdash;that the energy we
      devote to the alleviation of irremediable disease would be better spent in
      the study and practise of means to preserve health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, I tried to explain to Treherne, who will have plenty of money and
      influence, and whom, therefore, it is worth while taking pains to
      inoculate with a few useful facts and ideas; that one-half of our
      mortality in the Crimea was owing, not to the accidents of war, but to the
      results of zymotic diseases, all of which might have been prevented by
      common sense and common knowledge of the laws of health, as the statistics
      of our sanitary commission have abundantly proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as I told him, it saddens me, almost as much as doing my duty on a
      battle-field, or at Scutari, or Renkioi, to take these amateur rounds in
      safe England, among what poets and politicians call the noble British
      peasantry, and see the frightful sacrifice of life&mdash;and worse than
      life&mdash;from causes perfectly remediable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take, for instance, these cases, as set down in my note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amos Fell, 40, or thereabouts, down with fever for ten days; wife and five
      sons; occupy one room of a cottage on the Moor, which holds two other
      families; says, would be glad to live in a better place, but cannot get
      it; landlord will not allow more cottages to be built. Would build himself
      a peat hut, but doubts if that would be permitted; so just goes on as well
      as he can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peck family, fever also, living at the filthiest end of the village;
      themselves about the dirtiest in it; with a stream rushing by fresh enough
      to wash and cleanse a whole town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow Haynes, rheumatism, from field-work, and living in a damp room with
      earthen floor, half underground; decent woman, gets half-a-crown a-week
      from the parish, but will not be able to earn anything for months; and
      what is to become of all the children?
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne settled that question, and one or two more; poor fellow, his
      purse is as open as his heart just now; but among his other luxuries he
      may as well taste the luxury of giving.'Tis good for him; he will be Sir
      Augustus one of these days. Is his goddess aware of that fact, I wonder?
    </p>
    <p>
      What! is cynicism growing to be one of my vices? and against a woman too?
      One of whom I absolutely know nothing, except watching her for a few
      moments at a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seems to be one of the usual sort of officers' belles in country
      quarters. Yet there may be something good in her. There was, I feel sure,
      in that large-eyed sister of hers. But let me not judge&mdash;I have never
      had any opportunity of understanding women.
    </p>
    <p>
      This subject was not revived, till, the tobacco-hunger proving too strong
      for him, my friend Romeo began to fidget, and finally rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Doctor, you won't tell the governor&mdash;it would put him in an
      awful fume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;about Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; you know. I've been a
      great ass, I suppose, but when a girl is so civil to one&mdash;a fine
      girl, too&mdash;you saw her, did you not, dancing with me? Now isn't she
      an uncommonly fine girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that Granton should get her, confound him! a great logger-headed
      country clown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is an honest man, and will make her a kind husband. Any other honest
      man who does not mean to offer himself as her husband, had much better
      avoid her acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Treherne coloured again; I saw he understood me, though he turned it off
      with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're preaching matrimony, Doctor, surely. What an idea! to tie myself
      up at my age. I shan't do the ungentlemanly thing either. So good-night,
      old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lounged out, with that lazy, self-satisfied air which is misnamed
      aristocratic. Yet I have seen many a one of these conceited,
      effeminate-looking, drawing-room darlings, a curled and scented modern
      Alcibiades, fight&mdash;<i>like</i> Alcibiades; and die&mdash;as no Greek
      ever could die&mdash;like a Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungentlemanly,&rdquo;&mdash;what a word it is with most men, especially in the
      military profession. Gentlemanly,&mdash;the root and apex of all honour.
      Ungentlemanly,&mdash;the lowest term of degradation. Such is our code of
      morals in the army; and, more or less, probably everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer I knew, who, for all I ever heard or noticed, was himself as
      true a gentleman as ever breathed; polished, kindly, manly, and brave,
      gave me once, in an argument on duelling, his definition of the word. &ldquo;A
      <i>gentleman</i>&mdash;one who never does anything he is ashamed of, or
      that would compromise his honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Worldly honour, this colonel must have meant, for he considered it would
      have been compromised by a man's refusing to accept a challenge. That
      &ldquo;honour&rdquo; surely was a little lower thing than virtue; a little less pure
      than the Christianity which all of us profess, and so few believe. Yet
      there was something at once touching and heroic about it, and in the way
      this man of the world upheld it. The best of our British chivalry&mdash;as
      chivalry goes&mdash;is made up of materials such as these.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is there not a higher morality&mdash;a diviner honour? And if so, who
      is he that can find it?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">'T</span>is over&mdash;the
      weary dinner-party. I can lock myself in here, take off my dress, pull
      down my hair, clasp my two bare arms one on each shoulder&mdash;such a
      comfortable attitude!&mdash;and stare into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something peculiar about our fires. Most likely the quantity of
      fire-wood we use for this region gives them that curious aromatic smell.
      How, I love fir-trees of any sort in any season of the year! How I used to
      delight myself in our pine-woods, strolling in and out among the boles of
      the trees so straight, strong, and unchangeable&mdash;grave in summer, and
      green in winter! How I have stood listening to the wind in their tops, and
      looking for the fir-cones, wonderful treasures! which they had dropped on
      the soft dry mossy ground. What glorious fun it was to fill my pinafore&mdash;or
      in more dignified days my black silk apron&mdash;with fir-cones; to heap a
      surreptitious store of them in a corner of the school-room, and burn them,
      one by one, on the top of the fire. How they did blaze!
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I should almost like to go hunting for fir-cones now. It would be
      a great deal more amusing than dinner-parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did we give this dinner, which cost so much time, trouble, and money,
      and was so very dull? At least I thought so. Why should we always be
      obliged to have a dinner-party when Francis is here? As if he could not
      exist a week at Rockmount without other people's company than ours! It
      used not to be so. When I was a child, I remember he never wanted to go
      anywhere, or have anybody coming here. After study was over (and papa did
      not keep him very close either), he cared for nothing except to saunter
      about with Penelope. What a nuisance those two used to be to us younger
      ones: always sending us out of the room on some pretence, or taking us
      long walks and losing us, and then&mdash;cruellest of all,&mdash;keeping
      us waiting indefinitely for dinner. Always making so much of one another,
      and taking no notice of us; having little squabbles with one another, and
      then snubbing us. The great bore of our lives was that love-affair of
      Francis and Penelope; and the only consolation we had, Lisabel and I, was
      to plan the wedding, she to settle the bridesmaids' dresses, and I
      thinking how grand it would be when all is over, and I took the head of
      the table, the warm place in the room, permanently, as Miss Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Penelope! She is Miss Johnston still, and likely to be, for all that
      I can see. I should not wonder if, after all, it happened in ours as in
      many families, that the youngest is married first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel vexed me much to-day; more than usual. People will surely begin to
      talk about her, not that I care a pin for any gossip, but it's wrong&mdash;wrong!
      A girl can't like two gentlemen so equally that she treats them exactly in
      the same manner&mdash;unless it chances to be the manner of benevolent
      indifference. But Lisabel's is not that. Every day I watch her, and say to
      myself, &ldquo;She's surely fond of that young man.&rdquo; Which always happens to be
      the young man nearest to her, whether Captain Treherne, or &ldquo;my Colin,&rdquo; as
      his mother calls him. What a lot of &ldquo;beaux&rdquo; our Lisa has had ever since
      she was fourteen, yet not one &ldquo;lover&rdquo;&mdash;that I ever heard of; as, of
      course, I should, together with her half-dozen very particular friends. No
      one can accuse Lis of being of a secretive disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, am I growing ill-natured, and to my own sister? a good tempered,
      harmless girl, who makes herself agreeable to everybody, and whom
      everybody likes a vast deal better than they do me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, sitting over this fire, with the fir-twigs crackling and the
      turpentine blazing&mdash;it may be an odd taste, but I have a real
      pleasure in the smell of turpentine&mdash;I take myself into serious, sad
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora Johnston, aged twenty-five; medium looks, medium talents, medium
      temper; in every way the essence of mediocrity. This is what I have
      gradually discovered myself to be; I did not think so always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora Johnston, aged fifteen. What a different creature that was. I can
      bring it back now, with its long curls and its short frocks&mdash;by
      Penelope's orders, preserved as late as possible;&mdash;running wild over
      the moors, or hiding itself in the garden with a book,&mdash;or curling up
      in a corner of this attic, then unfurnished, with a pencil and the back of
      a letter, writing its silly poetry. Thinking, planning, dreaming, looking
      forward to such a wonderful, impossible life: quite satisfied with itself
      and all it was to do therein, since
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The world was all before it where to choose:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Reason its guard, and Providence its guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And what has it done? Nothing. What is it now? The aforesaid Theodora
      Johnston, aged twenty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moralists tell us, self-examination is a great virtue, an indispensable
      duty. I don't believe it. Generally, it is utterly useless, hopeless, and
      unprofitable. Much of it springs from the very egotism it pretends to
      cure. There are not more conceited hypocrites on earth than many of your
      &ldquo;miserable sinners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I cannot think of something or somebody better than myself, I will just
      give up thinking altogether: will pass entirely to the uppermost of my two
      lives, which I have now made to tally so successfully that they seem of
      one material: like our girls' new cloaks, which everybody imagines sober
      grey, till a lifting of the arms shows the other side of the cloth to be
      scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      That reminds me in what a blaze of scarlet Captain Treherne appeared at
      our modest dinner-table. He was engaged to a full-dress party at the Camp,
      he said, and must leave immediately after dinner,&mdash;which he didn't.
      Was his company much missed, I wonder? Two here could well have spared it&mdash;Colin
      Granton and Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      How odd that until to-night Captain Treherne should have had no notion
      that his cousin was engaged to our Penelope, or even visited at Rockmount.
      Odd too, that other people never told him. But it is such an old affair,
      and we were not likely to make the solemn communication ourselves;
      besides, we never knew much about the youth, except that he was one of
      Francis's fine relations. Yet to think that Francis all these years should
      never have even hinted to these said fine relations that he was engaged to
      our Penelope!
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were Penelope&mdash;but I have no business to judge other people. I
      never was in love, they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the meeting between these two was quite dramatic, and as funny as a
      farce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francis sitting on the sofa by Penelope, talking to Mrs. Granton and her
      friend Miss Emery, and doing a little bit of lazy love-making between
      whiles. When enters, late and hurried, Captain Treherne. He walks straight
      up to papa, specially attentive; then bows to Lisabel, specially distant
      and unattentive; (I thought, though, at sight of her he grew as hot as if
      his regimental collar were choking him); then hastens to pay his respects
      to Miss Johnston, when lo! he beholds Mr. Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charteris! what the&mdash;what a very unexpected pleasure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francis shook hands in what we call his usual fascinating manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Johnston!&rdquo;&mdash;in his surprise Captain Treherne had quite
      forgotten her&mdash;&ldquo;I really beg your pardon. I had not the slightest
      idea you were acquainted with my cousin.&rdquo; Nor did the young man seem
      particularly pleased with the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope glanced sharply at Francis, and then said&mdash;how did she
      manage to say it so carelessly and composedly!&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, we have known Mr. Charteris for a good many years. Can you find
      room for your cousin on the sofa, Francis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the &ldquo;Francis,&rdquo; Captain Treherne stared, and made some remarks in an
      abstract and abstracted manner. At length, when he had placed himself
      right between Francis and Penelope, and was actually going to take
      Penelope down to dinner, a light seemed to break upon him. He laughed&mdash;gave
      way to his cousin&mdash;and condescended to bestow his scarlet elbow upon
      me; saying as we went across the hall:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I was near making a blunder there.&mdash;But who would have
      thought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About those, there. I knew your sister was engaged to somebody&mdash;but
      Charteris! Who would have thought of Charteris going to be married. What a
      ridiculous idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, that the fact had ceased to appear so to me, having been aware of
      it for the last ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years! You don't say so!&rdquo; And then his slow perception catching the
      extreme incivility of this great astonishment&mdash;my scarlet friend
      offered lame congratulations, fell to his dinner, and conversed no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he forgot the matter altogether&mdash;for Lisabel sat opposite,
      beside Colin Granton; and what between love and hate my cavalier's
      attention was very much distracted. Truly, Lisabel and her unfortunate
      swains reminded me of a passage in &ldquo;Thomson's Seasons,&rdquo; describing two
      young bulls fighting in a meadow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;While the fair heifer balmy-breathing near,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Stands kindling up their rage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I blush to set it down. I blush almost to have such a thought, and
      concerning my own sister; yet it is so, and I have seen the like often and
      often. Surely it must be wrong; such sacred things as women's beauty and
      women's love were not made to set men mad at one another like brute
      beasts. Surely the woman could help it if she chose. Men may be jealous,
      and cross, and wretched; but they do not absolutely hate one another on a
      woman's account unless she has been in some degree to blame. While free,
      and shewing no preference, no one can well fight about her, for all have
      an equal chance; when she has a preference, though she might not openly
      shew it towards its object, she certainly would never think of shewing it
      towards anybody else. At least, that is my theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I am taking the thing too seriously, and it is no affair of mine.
      I have given up interfering long ago. Lisabel must &ldquo;gang her ain gate,&rdquo; as
      they say in Scotland. By the bye, Captain Treherne asked if we came from
      Scotland, or were of the celebrated clan Johnstone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was, when in spite of the additional <i>t,</i> we all grumbled at our
      plebeian name, hoping earnestly to change it for something more
      aristocratic,&mdash;and oh, how proud we were of Charteris! How fine to
      put into the village post, letters addressed, &ldquo;Francis Charteris, Esq.,&rdquo;
       and to speak of our brother-in-law elect as having &ldquo;an office under
      Government!&rdquo; We firmly believed that office under Government would end in
      the Premiership and a peerage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has not, though. Francis still says he cannot afford to marry; I was
      asking Penelope yesterday if she knew what papa and his first wife, not
      our own mamma, married upon? Much less income, I believe, than what
      Francis has now. But my sister said I did not understand: &ldquo;The cases were
      widely different.&rdquo; Probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is very fond of Francis. Last week, preparing for him, she looked
      quite a different woman; quite young and rosy again; and though it did not
      last, though after he was really come, she grew sharp and cross often,&mdash;to
      us, never to him, of course;&mdash;she much enjoys his being here. They do
      not make so much fuss over one another as they did ten years ago, which
      indeed would be ridiculous in lovers over thirty. Still, I should hardly
      like my lover, at any age, to sit reading a novel half the evening, and
      spend the other half in the sweet company of his cigar. Not that he need
      be always hankering after me, and &ldquo;paying me attention.&rdquo; I should hate
      that. For what is the good of people being fond of one another, if they
      can't be content simply in one another's company, or, without it even, in
      one another's love? letting each go on their own several ways and do their
      several work, in the best manner they can. Good sooth! I should be the
      most convenient and least troublesome sweetheart that ever a young man was
      ever blessed with; for I am sure I should sit all evening quite happy&mdash;he
      at one end of the room, and I at the other, if only I knew he was happy,
      and caught now and then a look and a smile&mdash;provided the look and the
      smile were my own personal property, nobody else's.
    </p>
    <p>
      What nonsense am I writing? And not a word about the dinner-party. Has it
      left so little impression on my mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder! It was just the usual thing. Papa as host, grave, clerical, and
      slightly wearying of it all. Penelope hostess. Francis playing &ldquo;friend of
      the family,&rdquo; as handsome and well-dressed as ever&mdash;what an
      exquisitely embroidered shirt-front, and what an aërial cambric kerehief!
      which must have taken him half an hour to tie! Lisabel&mdash;but I have
      told about her; and myself. Everybody else looking as everybody hereabouts
      always does look at dinner-parties&mdash;<i>ex uno disce omnes</i>&mdash;to
      muster a bit of the Latin for which, in old times, Francis used to call me
      &ldquo;a juvenile prig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was there, in the whole evening, anything worth remembering? Yes, thanks
      to his fit of jealousy, I did get a little sensible conversation out of
      Captain Treherne. He looked so dull, so annoyed, that I felt sorry for the
      youth, and tried to make him talk; so, lighting on the first subject at
      hand, asked him if he had seen his friend, Doctor Urquhart, lately?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;who? I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes had wandered where Lisabel, with one of her white elbows on the
      table, sat coquetting with a bunch of grapes, listening with downcast eyes
      to &ldquo;my Colin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, whom I met at the Cedars last week. You said he was a
      friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is; the best I ever had,&rdquo; and it was refreshing to see how the
      young fellow brightened up. &ldquo;He saved my life. But for him I should
      assuredly be lying with a cross over my head, inside that melancholy stone
      wall round the top of Cathcart's Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the cemetery there.&mdash;What sort of a place is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I said&mdash;the bare top of a hill, with a wall round it, and
      stones of various sorts, crosses, monuments, and so on. All our officers
      were buried there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anywhere. It didn't matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not, I thought; but not exactly from Captain Treherne's point of
      view. However, he was scarcely the man with whom to have started an
      abstract argument. I might, had he been Doctor Urquhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Doctor Urquhart in the Crimea the whole time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. He went through all the campaign, from Varna to Sebastopol;
      at first unattached, and then was appointed to our regiment. Well for me
      that! What a three months I had after Inkerman! Shall I ever forget the
      day I first crawled out and sat on the benches in front of the hospital,
      on Balaklava Heights, looking down over the Black Sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen him serious before. My heart inclined even to Captain
      Treherne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he ever hurt&mdash;Doctor Urquhart, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once or twice, slightly, while looking after his wounded on the field.
      But he made no fuss about it, and always got well directly. You see, he is
      such an extremely temperate man in all things&mdash;such a quiet temper&mdash;has
      himself in such thorough control&mdash;that he has twice the chance of
      keeping in health that most men have&mdash;especially our fellows there,
      who, he declares, died quite as much of eating, drinking, and smoking, as
      they did of Russian bullets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend must be a remarkable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a&mdash;a brick! Excuse the word&mdash;in ladies' society I ought
      not to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ought to use it at all, you may do so in ladies' society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Miss Dora, he really is a downright <i>brick</i>&mdash;since
      you know what that means. Though an odd sort of fellow too; a tough
      customer to deal with&mdash;never lets go the rein; holds one in as tight
      as if he were one's father. I say, Charteris, did you ever hear the
      governor speak of Doctor Urquhart, of ours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Sir William had named such a person, Mr. Charteris had, unfortunately,
      quite forgotten it. Stay&mdash;he fancied he had heard the name at his
      club, but it was really impossible to remember all the names one knew, or
      the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't have forgotten that man in a hurry, Miss Dora, I assure you.
      He's worth a dozen of&mdash;&mdash; but I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If it was for the look which he cast upon his cousin, I was not
      implacable. Francis always annoys me when he assumes that languid manner.
      For some things, I prefer Captain Treherne's open silliness&mdash;nothing
      being in his head, nothing can come out of it&mdash;to the lazy
      superciliousness of Francis Charteris; who, we know, has a great deal more
      in him than he ever condescends to let out, at least for our benefit. I
      should like to see if he behaves any better at his aforesaid club, or at
      Lady This's and the Countess of That's, of whom I heard him speak to Miss
      Emery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thinking thus;&mdash;vaguely contrasting his smooth, handsome face
      with that sharp one of Penelope's&mdash;how much faster she grows old than
      he does, though they are exactly of an age!&mdash;when the ladies rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Treherne and Colin rushed to open the door&mdash;Francis did not
      take that trouble&mdash;and Lisabel, passing, smiled equally on both her
      adorers. Colin made some stupid compliment; and the other, silent, looked
      her full in the face. If any man so dared to look at me, I would like to
      grind him to powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! I'm sick of love and lovers&mdash;or the mockery of them&mdash;sick to
      the core of my heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room I curled myself up in a corner beside Mrs. Granton,
      whom it is always pleasant to talk to. We revived the great blanket, beef,
      and anti-beer question, in which she said she had found an unexpected
      ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who argues, even more strongly than your father and I, my dear&mdash;as
      I was telling Mr. Johnston to-day at dinner, and wishing they were
      acquainted&mdash;argues <i>against</i> the beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a question of whether or not our poor people should have beer
      with their Christmas dinner. Papa, who holds strong opinions against the
      use of intoxicating drinks, and never tastes them himself, being, every
      year, rather in ill odour on the subject. I asked who was this valuable
      ally?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of our neighbours, you may be sure. A gentleman from the camp&mdash;you
      may have met him at my house&mdash;a Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help smiling, and said it was curious how I was perpetually
      hearing of Doctor Urquhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in our quiet neighbourhood, such a man is sure to be talked about.
      Not in society perhaps&mdash;it was quite a marvel for Colin to get him to
      our ball, but because he does so many things while we humdrum folk are
      only thinking about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked what sort of things? In his profession?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiefly, but he makes professional business include so much. Imagine his
      coming to Colin as ground-landlord of Bourne hamlet, to beg him to see to
      the clearing of the village pool? or writing to the lord of the manor,
      saying that twenty new cottages built on the moor would do more moral good
      than the new county reformatory? He is one of the very few men who are not
      ashamed to say what they think&mdash;and makes people listen to it too&mdash;as
      they rarely do to those not long settled in the neighbourhood, and about
      whom they know little or nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked if nothing were known about Doctor Urquhart? Had he any relations?
      Was he married?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, surely not married. I never enquired, but took it for granted.
      However, probably my son knows. Shall I find out, and speak a good word
      for you, Miss Dora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said I, laughing. &ldquo;You know I hate soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Tis Mrs. Granton's only fault&mdash;her annoying jests after this
      fashion. Otherwise, I would have liked to have asked a few more questions
      about Doctor Urquhart. I wonder if I shall ever meet him again? The
      regiments rarely stay long at the camp, so that it is not probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went over to where my two sisters and Miss Emery were sitting over the
      fire. Miss Emery was talking very fast, and Penelope listening with a
      slightly scornful lip; she protests that ladies, middle-aged ladies
      particularly, are such very stupid company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel wore her good-natured smile, always the same to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was quite pleased,&rdquo; Miss Emery was saying, &ldquo;to notice how cordially
      Captain Treherne and Mr. Charteris met: I always understood there was a
      sort of a&mdash;a coolness, in short. Very natural. As his nephew, and
      next heir, after the Captain, Sir William might have done more than he did
      for Mr. Charteris. So people said, at least. He has a splendid property,
      and only that one son. You have been to Treherne Court, Miss Johnston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penelope abruptly answered, &ldquo;No;&rdquo; and Lisabel added amiably, that we
      seldom went from home&mdash;papa liked to have us at Rockmount all the
      year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said wilfully, wickedly,&mdash;may be, lest Miss Emery's long tongue
      should carry back to London what was by implication not true&mdash;that we
      did not even know where Treherne Court was, and that we had only met
      Captain Treherne accidentally among the camp-officers who visited at the
      Cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lis pinched me: Penelope looked annoyed. Was it a highly virtuous act thus
      to have vexed both my sisters? Alack! I feel myself growing more unamiable
      every day. What will be the end of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First come, first served,&rdquo; must have been Lisabel's motto for the
      evening, since, Captain Treherne re-appearing, scarlet beat plain black
      clear out of the field. I was again obliged to follow, as Charity, pouring
      the oil and wine of my agreeable conversation into the wounds made by my
      sister's bright eyes, and receiving as gratitude such an amount of
      information on turnips, moor-lands, and the true art of sheep-feeding, as
      will make me look with respect and hesitation on every leg of mutton that
      comes to our table for the next six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;O, Colin, dear Colin, my Colin, my dear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who wont the wild mountains to trace without fear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O, where are thy flocks that so swiftly rebound,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And fly o'er the heath without touching the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable fact in natural history, which much impressed me in my
      childhood. What is the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Where the birch-tree hangs weeping o'er fountain so
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      clear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At noon I shall meet him, my Colin, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What a shame to laugh at Mrs. Grant of Laggan's nice old song, at the
      pretty Highland tune which ere now I have hummed over the moor for miles.
      Since, when we were children, I myself was in love with Colin! a love
      which found vent in much petting of his mother, and in shy presents to
      himself of nuts and blackberries: until, stung by indifference, my
      affection
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;Shrunk
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Into itself, and was missing ever after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we forget our childish loves? I think not. The objects change, of
      course, but the feeling, when it has been true and unselfish, keeps its
      character still, and is always pleasant to remember. It was very silly, no
      doubt, but I question if now I could love anybody in a fonder, humbler,
      faithfuller way than I adored that great, merry, good-natured schoolboy.
      And though I know he has not an ounce of brains, is the exact opposite of
      anybody I could fall in love with now&mdash;still, to this day, I look
      kindly on the round, rosy face of &ldquo;Colin, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if he ever will marry our Lisa. As far as I notice, people do not
      often marry their childish companions; they much prefer strangers.
      Possibly, from mere novelty and variety, or else from the fact that as kin
      are sometimes &ldquo;less than kind,&rdquo; so one's familiar associates are often the
      furthest from one's sympathies, interests, or heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this highly moral and amiable sentiment&mdash;a fit conclusion for a
      social evening, I will lock my desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucky I did! What if Lisabel had found me writing at&mdash;one in the
      morning! How she would have teased me&mdash;even under the circumstances
      of last night, which seem to have affected her mighty little, considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard her at my door, from without, grumble at it being bolted. She came
      in and sat down by my fire. Quite a picture, in a blue flannel
      dressing-gown, with her light hair dropping down in two wavy streams, and
      her eyes as bright as if it were any hour rather than 1.30 a.m., as I
      showed her by my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I shall not go to bed yet. I want to talk a bit, Dora; you
      ought to feel flattered by my coming to tell you, first of anybody. Guess
      now,&mdash;what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing ill, certainly&mdash;for she held her head up, laughing a little,
      looking very handsome and pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will guess, for you never believed it would come to pass, but
      it has. Treherne proposed to me to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news quite took my breath away, and then I questioned its accuracy.
      &ldquo;He has only been giving you a few more of his silly speeches, he means
      nothing. Why don't you put a stop to it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel was not vexed&mdash;she never is&mdash;she only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Dora, it is perfectly true. You may believe or not,&mdash;I
      don't care&mdash;but he really did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, when, and where, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the conservatory; beside the biggest orange-tree; a few minutes before
      he left.&rdquo; I said, since she was so very matter-of-fact, perhaps, she would
      have no objection to tell me the precise words in which he &ldquo;did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no; not the smallest objection. We were joking about a bit of
      orange-blossom Colin had given me, and Treherne wanted me to throw away;
      but I said 'No, I liked the scent, and meant to wear a wreath of natural
      orange-flowers when I was married.' Upon which he grew quite furious, and
      said it would drive him mad if I ever married any man but him. Then he got
      hold of my hand, and&mdash;the usual thing, you know.&rdquo; She blushed a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ended by my telling him he had better speak to papa, and he said he
      should, tomorrow. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Lisabel, expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was a singular way in which to receive one's sister's
      announcement of her intended marriage; but, for worlds, I could not have
      spoken a syllable. I felt a weight on my chest&mdash;a sense of hot
      indignation which settled down into inconceivable melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this indeed all? A silly flirtation&mdash;a young lad's passion&mdash;a
      young girl's cool business-like reception of the same&mdash;the formal
      &ldquo;speaking to papa,&rdquo; and the thing was over! Was <i>that</i> love?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you a word to say, Dora? I had better have told Penelope. But she
      was tired, and scolded me out of her room. Besides she might not exactly
      like this, for some reasons. It's rather hard; such an important thing to
      happen, and not a soul to congratulate one upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked, why might Penelope dislike it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see? Captain Treherne roving about the world, and Captain
      Treherne married and settled at home, make a considerable difference to
      Francis's prospects. No, I don't mean anything mean or murderous&mdash;you
      need not look so shocked&mdash;it is merely my practical way of regarding
      things. But what harm? If I did not have Treherne, somebody else would,
      and it would be none the better for Francis and Penelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very prudent and far-sighted: such an idea would never have
      entered my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay not. Just give me that brush, will you, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She proceeded methodically to damp her long hair, and plait it up in those
      countless tails which gave Miss Lisabel Johnston's locks such a beautiful
      wave. Passing the glass, she looked into it, smiled, sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow. I do believe he is very fond of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like him&mdash;like him excessively. If I didn't, what should I
      marry him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one objection papa may have; his being younger than I, I forget
      how much, but it is very little. How surprised papa will be when he gets
      the letter to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Sir William know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet; but that will be soon settled, he tells me. He can persuade his
      mother, and she, his father. Besides, they can have no possible objection
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked again in the mirror as she said this. Yes, that &ldquo;me&rdquo; was not a
      daughter-in-law likely to be objected to, even at Treherne Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will not vex Penelope,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It may be all the
      better for her, since when I am married, I shall have so much influence.
      We may make the old gentleman do something handsome for Francis, and get a
      richer living for papa, if he will consent to leave Rockmount. And I'd
      find a nice husband for you, eh, Dora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I don't want one. I hate the very mention of the thing. I
      wish, instead of marrying, we could all be dead and buried.&rdquo; And, whether
      from weariness, or excitement, or a sudden, unutterable pang at seeing my
      sister, my playfellow, my handsome Lisa, sitting there, talking as she
      talked, and acting as she acted, I could bear up no longer. I burst out
      sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very much astonished, and somewhat touched, I suppose, for she
      cried too, a little, and we kissed one another several times, which we are
      not much in the habit of doing.&mdash;Till, suddenly, I recollected
      Treherne, the orange-tree, and &ldquo;the usual thing.&rdquo; Her lips seemed to burn
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lisa, I wish you wouldn't. I do wish you wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't what? Don't you want me to be engaged and married, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not tell. I did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the fashion of Francis and Penelope, perhaps? Falling in love like
      a couple of babies, before they knew their own minds, and then being tied
      together, and keeping the thing on in a stupid, meaningless, tiresome way,
      till she is growing into an elderly woman, and he&mdash;no, thank you, I
      have seen quite enough of early loves and long engagements. I always meant
      to have somebody whom I could marry at once, and be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a half-truth in what she said, though I could not then find the
      other half to fit into it, and prove that her satisfactory circle of
      reasoning was partly formed of absolute, untenable falsehood, for false I
      am sure it was. Though I cannot argue it, can hardly understand it, I <i>feel
      it</i>. There must be a truth somewhere. Love cannot be all a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister and I talked a few minutes longer, and then she rose, and said
      she must go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not wish me happiness? 'Tis very unkind of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her outright that I did not think as she thought on these matters,
      but that she had made her choice, and I hoped it would be a happy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it. Now go to bed, and don't cry any more, there's a good
      girl, for there really is nothing to cry about. You shall have the very
      prettiest bridesmaid's dress I can afford, and Treherne Court will be such
      a nice house for you to visit at. Good night, Dora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange, altogether strange!
    </p>
    <p>
      And writing it all down this morning, I feel it stranger than ever, still.

      CHAPTER V. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> will set down, if
      only to get rid of them, a few incidents of this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trivial they are&mdash;ludicrously so&mdash;to any one but me: yet they
      have left me sitting with my head in my hands, stupid and idle, starting,
      each hour, at the boom of the bell we took at Sebastopol&mdash;starting
      and shivering like a nervous child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange! there, in the Crimea, in the midst of danger, hardship, and
      misery of all kinds I was at peace, even happy: happier than for many
      years. I seemed to have lived down, and nearly obliterated from thought,
      that one day, one hour, one moment,&mdash;which was but a moment. Can it,
      or ought it, to weigh against a whole existence? or, as some religionists
      would tell us, against an eternity? Yet, what is time, what is eternity?
      And, what is man, measuring himself, his atom of good or ill, either done
      or suffered, against God?
    </p>
    <p>
      These are vain speculations, which I have gone over and over again, till
      every link in the chain of reasoning is painfully familiar. I had better
      give it up, and turn to ordinary things. Dear imaginary correspondent,
      shall I tell you the story of my day?
    </p>
    <p>
      It began peacefully. I always rest on a Sunday, if I can. I believe, even
      had heaven not hallowed one day in the seven&mdash;Saturday or Sunday
      matters not; let Jews and Christians battle it out!&mdash;there would
      still be needful a day of rest; and that day would still be a blessed day.
      Instinct, old habit, and later conviction always incline me to &ldquo;keep the
      sabbath:&rdquo;&mdash;not, indeed, after the strict fashion of my forefathers,
      but as a happy, cheerful, holy time, a resting-place between week and
      week, in which to enjoy specially all righteous pleasures and earthly
      repose, and to look forward to that rest which, we are told, &ldquo;remaineth
      for the people of God.&rdquo; The people of God. No other people ever do rest,
      even in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne passed my hut soon after breakfast, and popped his head in, not
      over welcomely, I confess, for I was giving myself the rare treat of a bit
      of unprofessional reading. I had not seen him for two or three days,&mdash;not
      since we appointed to go together to the General's dinner, and he never
      appeared all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Doctor, will you go to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, I do usually attend our airy military chapel&mdash;all doors and
      windows&mdash;open to every kind of air, except airs from heaven, of
      which, I am afraid, our chaplain does not bring with him a large quantity.
      He leaves us to fatten upon Hebrew roots, without throwing us a crumb of
      Christianity; prefers Moses and the prophets to the New Testament; no
      wonder, as some few doctrines there, &ldquo;Do unto others as ye would they
      should do unto you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword!&rdquo;... would sound
      particularly odd in a military chapel, especially with his elucidation of
      them, for he is the very poorest preacher I ever heard. Yet a worthy man,
      a most sincere man: did a world of good out in the Crimera: used to spend
      hours daily in teaching our men to read and write, got personally
      acquainted with every fellow in the regiment, knew all their private
      histories, wrote their letters home sought them out in the battle-field
      and in the hospital, read to them and cheered them, comforted them, and
      closed their eyes. There was not an officer in the regiment more
      deservedly beloved than our chaplin. He is an admirable fellow&mdash;
      everywhere but in the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless I attend his chapel, as I have always been in the habit of
      attending some Christian worshi somewhere, because it is the simplest way
      of showing that I am not ashamed of my Master before men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I would not smile at Trehune's astonishing fit of piety, but
      simply assented: at which he evidently was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, I'm turning resectable and going to church. I wonder such an
      exceedingly respectable and religious fellow as you, Urquhart, has not
      tried to make me go sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go against your will, and because it's respectable, you had better
      stop away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; but suppose I have my own reasons for going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He is not a deep fellow; there is no deceit in the lad. All his faults are
      uppermost, which makes them bearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, out with it. Better make a clean breast to me. It will not be the
      first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;ahem!&rdquo;&mdash;twisting his sash and looking down with
      most extraordinary modesty,&mdash;&ldquo;the fact is, <i>she</i> wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady you know of. In truth, I may as well tell you, for I want you to
      speak up for me to her father, and also to break it to my governor. I've
      taken your advice and been and gone and done for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; for his manner was so queer that I should not have wondered at
      even that catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite, but next door to it. Popped and been accepted. Yes, since
      Friday, I have been an engaged man, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind his foolishness was some natural feeling, mixed with a rather
      comical awe of his own position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, I was a good deal surprised; yet he might have come to a worse
      end. To a rich young fellow of twenty-one, the world is full of many more
      dangerous pitfalls than matrimony. So I expressed myself in the customary
      congratulations, adding that I concluded the lady was the one I had seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir William knows it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Didn't I tell you I wanted you to break it to him? Though he
      will consent, of course. Her father is quite respectable&mdash;a
      clergyman, you are aware; and she is such a handsome girl&mdash;would do
      credit to any man's taste. Also, she likes me&mdash;a trifle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pulled his moustache with a satisfied recognition of his great
      felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw no reason to question it, such as it was. He was a well-looking
      fellow, likely to please women; and this one, though there was not much in
      her, appeared kindly and agreeable. The other sister, whom I talked with,
      was something more. They were, no doubt, a perfectly unobjectionable
      family; nor did I think that Sir William, who was anxious for his son to
      marry early, would refuse consent to any creditable choice. But,
      decidedly, He ought to be told at once&mdash;ought indeed to have been
      consulted beforehand. I said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help that. It happened unexpectedly. I had, when I entered
      rockmount, no more idea of such a thing than&mdash;than your cat, Doctor.
      Upon my soul 'tis the fact! Well, well, marriage is a man's fate. He can
      no more help himself in the matter than a stone can help rolling down a
      hill. All's over, and I'm glad of it. So, will you write, and tell my
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Do it yourself, and you had better do it now. 'No time
      like the present,' always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pushed towards him pens, ink, and paper; and returned to my book again;
      but it was not quite absorbing; and occasional glimpses of Treherne's
      troubled and puzzled face amused me, as well as made me thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that having been in some slight way concerned in it, this
      matter, foreign as it was to the general tenor of my busy life, should
      interest me a little. Though I viewed it, not from the younger, but from
      the elder side. I myself never knew either father or mother; they died
      when I was a child; but I think, whether or not we possess it in youth, we
      rarely come to my time of life without having a strong instinctive feeling
      of the rights of parents&mdash;being worthy parents. Rights, of course
      modified in their extent by the higher claims of the Father of all, but
      second to none other; except, perhaps, those whieh He has Himself made
      superior&mdash;the rights of husband and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt, when I came to consider it, exceedingly sorry that Treherne had
      made a proposal of marriage without consulting his father. But it was no
      concern of mine. Even his &ldquo;taking my advice&rdquo; was, he knew well, his own
      exaggeration of an abstract remark which I could not but make; otherwise,
      I had not meddled in his courting, which, in my opinion, no third party
      has a right to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I washed my hands of the whole affair, except consenting to Treherne's
      earnest request that I would go with him, this morning, to the little
      village church of which the young lady's father was the clergyman, and be
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tough old gentleman, too; as sharp as a needle, as hard as a rock,&mdash;walking
      into his study, yesterday morning, was no joke, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said he had consented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, all's right. That is, it will be when I hear from the governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this while, by a curious amatory eccentricity, he had never mentioned
      the lady's name. Nor had I asked, because I knew it. Also, because that
      surname, common as it is, is still extremely painful to me, either to
      utter or to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came late into church, and sat by the door. It was a pleasant September
      forenoon; there was sunshine within and sunshine outside, far away across
      the moors. I had never been to this village before; it seemed a pretty
      one, and the church old and picturesque. The congregation consisted almost
      entirely of poor people, except one family, which I concluded to be the
      clergyman's. He was in the reading-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's her father,&rdquo; whispered Treherne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed.&rdquo; But I did not look at him for a minute or so; I could not.
      Such moments will come, despite of reasoning, belief, conviction, when I
      see a person bearing any name resembling <i>that</i> name.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I lifted my head to observe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A calm, hard, regular face; well-shaped features; high, narrow forehead,
      aquiline nose,&mdash;a totally different type from one which I so well
      remember that any accidental likeness thereto impresses me as startlingly
      and vividly as, I have heard, men of tenacious, fervent memory will have
      impressed on them, through life, as their favourite type of beauty, the
      countenance of their first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could sit down now, at ease, and listen to this gentleman's reading of
      the prayers. His reading was what might have been expected from his face&mdash;classical,
      accurate, intelligent, gentlemanly. And the congregation listened with
      respect, as to a clever exposition of things quite beyond their
      comprehension. Except the gabble-gabble of the Sunday-school, and the
      clerk's loud &ldquo;A-a-men!&rdquo; the minister had the service entirely to himself.&mdash;A
      beautiful service&mdash;as I, though in heart a Presbyterian still, must
      avow. Especially, when heard as I have heard it&mdash;at sea, in hospital,
      at the camp. Not this camp, but ours in the Crimea, where, all through the
      prayers, guns kept booming, and shells kept flying, sometimes within a
      short distance of the chapel itself. I mind of one Sunday, little more
      than a year ago, for it must have been on the ninth of September, when I
      stopped on my way from Balaklava hospital, to hear service read in the
      open air, on a hill-side. It was a cloudy day, I remember; below, brown
      with long drought, stretched the Balaklava plains; opposite, grey and
      still, rose the high mountains on the other side of the Tchernaya; while,
      far away to the right, towards our camp, one could just trace the white
      tents of the Highland regiments; and to the left, hidden by the Col de
      Balaklava, a dull, perpetual rumble, and clouds of smoke hanging in the
      air, showed where, six miles off, was being enacted the fall of
      Sebastopol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Though at the time we did not know; we, this little congregation,
      mustered just outside a hospital tent, where I remember, not a stone's
      throw from where we, the living, knelt, lay a row of those straight,
      still, formless forms, the more awful because, from familiarity, they had
      ceased to be felt as such&mdash;-each sewn up in the blanket, its only
      coffin, waiting for burial&mdash;waiting also, we believe and hope, for
      the resurrection from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sermon our chaplain might have preached! what words I, or any man,
      could surely have found to say at such a time, on such a spot! Yet what we
      did hear, were the merest platitudes&mdash;so utterly trivial and out of
      place, that I do not now recall a single sentence. Strange, that people&mdash;good
      Christian men, as I knew that man to be&mdash;should go on droning out
      &ldquo;words, words, words,&rdquo; when bodies and souls perish in thousands round
      them; or splitting theological hairs to poor fellows, who, except in an
      oath, are ignorant even of the Divine Name,&mdash;or thundering anathemas
      at them for going down to the pit of perdition, without even so much as
      pointing out to them the bright but narrow way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting thus, absorbed in the heavy thoughts that often come to me
      when thus quiet in church, hearing some man, who is supposed to be one of
      the church's teachers, delivering the message of the church's Great Head,&mdash;when
      looking up, I saw two eyes fixed on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the clergyman's three daughters; the youngest, probably, for
      her seat was in the most uncomfortable corner of the pew. &mdash;Apparently,
      the same I had talked with at Mrs. Granton's, though I was not sure,&mdash;ladies
      look so different in their bonnets. Her's was close, I noticed, and
      decently covering the head, not dropping off on her shoulders like those I
      see ladies wearing, which will assuredly multiply ophthalmic cases, with
      all sorts of head and face complaints, as the winter winds come on. Such
      exposure must be very painful, too, these blinding sunny days. How can
      women stand the torments they have to undergo in matters of dress? If I
      had any woman-kind belonging to me&mdash;Pshaw! what an idle speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those two eyes, steadfastly inquiring, with a touch of compassion in them,
      startled me. Many a pair of eager eyes have I had to meet, but it was
      always their own fate, or that of some one dear to them, which they were
      anxious to learn: they never sought to know anything of me or mine. Now,
      these did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am nervously sensitive of even kindly scrutiny. Involuntarily, I moved
      so that one of the pillars came between me and those eyes. When we stood
      up to sing, she kept them steadily upon her hymn-book, nor did they wander
      again during church-time, either towards me or in any other direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face being just opposite, in the line of the pulpit, I could not help
      seeing it during the whole of the discourse, which was, as I expected,
      classical, laboured, elegant, and interesting,&mdash;after the pattern of
      the preacher's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter is not like him. In repose, her features are ordinary; nor
      did they for one moment recall to me the flashing, youthful face, full of
      action and energy, which had amused me that night at the Cedars. Some
      faces catch the reflection of the moment so vividly, that you never see
      them twice alike. Others, solidly and composedly handsome scarcely vary at
      all, and I think it is of these last that one would soonest weary.
      Irregular features have generally most character. The Venus di Medici
      would have made a very stupid fireside companion, nor would I venture to
      enter, for Oxford honours, a son who had the profile of the Apollo
      Belvidere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne is evidently of a different opinion. He sat beaming out
      admiration upon that large, fair, statuesque woman, who had turned so that
      her pure Greek profile was distinctly visible against the red cloth of'
      the high pew. She might have known what a pretty picture she was making.
      She will please Sir William, who admires beauty, and she seems refined
      enough, even for Lady Augusta Treherne. I thought to myself, the lad might
      have gone farther and fared worse. His marriage was sure to have been one
      of pure accident: he is not a young man either to have had the decision to
      choose, or the firmness to win and keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service ended, he asked me what I thought of her; and I said much as I
      have written here. He appeared satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stay and be introduced to the family: the father remains in
      church. I shall walk home with them. Ah, she sees us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad was all eagerness and excitement. He must be considerably in
      earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Doctor, come, nay, pray do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesitation was too late, however: the introduction took place: Treherne
      hurried it over; though I listened acutely, I could not be certain of the
      name. It seemed to be, as I already believed, <i>Johnson</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne's beauty met him, all smiles, and he marched off by her side in a
      most determined manner, the eldest sister following and joining the pair,
      doubtless to the displeasure of one, or both. She, whom I did not remember
      seeing before, is a little sharp-speaking woman, pretty, but
      faded-looking, with very black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other sister, left behind, fell in with me. We walked side by side
      through the churchyard, and into the road. As I held the wicket gate open
      for her to pass, she looked up, smiled, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you do not remember me, Dr. Urquhart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied, &ldquo;Yes I did:&rdquo; that she was the young lady who &ldquo;hated soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed extremely, glanced at Treherne, and said, not without dignity:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a pity to remember all the foolish things I have uttered,
      especially on that evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware they were foolish; the impression left on me was that we
      had had a very pleasant conversation, which included far more sensible
      topics than are usually discussed at balls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not often go to balls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dislike them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they are wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at her cross-questioning, which had something fresh and
      unsophisticated about it, like the inquisitiveness of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I have never very deeply considered the question; my going, or
      not going, is purely a matter of individual choice. I went to the Cedars
      that night because Mrs. Granton was so kind as to wish it, and I was only
      too happy to please her. I like her extremely, and owe her much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a very good woman,&rdquo; was the earnest answer. &ldquo;And Colin has the
      kindest heart in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assented, though amused at the superlatives in which very young people
      delight; but, in this case, not so far away from truth as ordinarily
      happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Colin Granton;&mdash;have you seen him lately&mdash;yesterday I
      mean? Did Captain Treherne see him yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The anxiety with which the question was put reminded me of something
      Treherne had mentioned, which implied his rivalry with Granton; perhaps
      this kind-hearted damsel thought there would be a single-handed combat on
      our parade-ground, between the accepted and rejected swains. I allayed her
      fears by observing, that to my certain knowledge, Mr. Granton had gone up
      to London on Saturday morning, and would not return till Tuesday. Then,
      our eyes meeting, we both looked conscious; but, of course, neither the
      young lady nor myself made any allusion to present circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, generally, that Granton was a fine young fellow, not over
      sentimental, nor likely to feel anything very deeply; but gifted with
      great good sense, sufficient to make an admirable country-squire, and one
      of the best landlords in the county, if only he could be brought to feel
      the importance of his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His responsibility, as a man of fortune, to make the most of his wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&mdash;what is there for him to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty, if he could only be got to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not get him to do it?&rdquo; with another look of the eager eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;I know so very little of the young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have so much influence, I hear, over everybody. That is, Mrs.
      Granton says.&mdash;We have known the Grantons ever since I was a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From her blush, which seemed incessantly to come, sudden and sensitive as
      a child's, I imagined that time was not so very long ago: until she said
      something about &ldquo;my youngest sister,&rdquo; which proved I had been mistaken in
      her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easier to talk to a young girl sitting forlorn by herself in a
      ball-room, than to a grown-up lady, walking in broad daylight, accompanied
      by two other ladies, who, though clergymen's daughters, are as stylish
      fashionables as ever irritated my sober vision. She did not, I must
      confess; she seemed to be the plain one of the family: unnoticed&mdash;one
      might almost guess, neglected. Nor was there any flightiness or
      coquettishness in her manner, which, though abrupt and original, was quiet
      even to demure ness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing my hobby of anatomising character, I studied her a good deal
      during the pauses of conversation, of which there were not a few. Compared
      with Treherne, whom I heard in advance, laughing and talking with his
      usual light-heartedness, she must have found me uncommonly sombre and
      dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was pleasant to be strolling leisurely along, one's feet dropping
      softly down through rustling dead leaves into the dry, sandy mould which
      is peculiar to this neighbourhood: you may walk in it, ancle-deep, for
      miles, across moors and under pine-woods, without soiling a shoe. Pleasant
      to see the sunshine striking the boughs of the trees, and lying in broad,
      bright rifts on the ground here and there, wherever there was an opening
      in the dense green tops of those fine Scotch firs, the like of which I
      have never beheld out of my own country, nor there since I was quite a
      boy. Also, the absence of other forest trees, the high elevation, the wide
      spaces of moorland, and the sandy soil, give to the atmosphere here a
      rarity and freshness which exhilarates, mentally and bodily, in no small
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank God I have never lost my love of nature; never ceased to feel an
      almost boyish thrill of delight in the mere sunshine and fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      For miles I could have walked on, thus luxuriating, without wishing to
      disturb my enjoyment by a word, but it was necessary to converse a little,
      so I made the valuable and original remark &ldquo;that this neighbourhood would
      be very pretty in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion replied with a vivacity of indignation most unlike a grown
      young lady, and exceedingly like a child:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty? It is beautiful! You never can have seen it, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;My regiment did not come home till May: I had spent this spring
      in the Crimea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the spring flowers there, I have heard, are remarkably beautiful,
      much more so than ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and as she seemed fond of flowers, I told her of the great
      abundance which in the peaceful spring that followed the war, we had
      noticed, carpeting with a mass of colour those dreary plains; the large
      Crimean snow-drops, the jonquils, and blue hyacinths, growing in myriads,
      about Balaklava and on the banks of the Tchernaya; while on every rocky
      dingle, and dipping into every tiny brook, hung bushes of the delicate
      yellow jasmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely! But I would not exchange England for it. You should see how
      the primroses grew all along that bank, and a little beyond, outside the
      wood, is a hedge side, which will be one mass of blue-bells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall look for them. I have often found blue-bells till the end of
      October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; What a laugh it was, with such a merry ring. &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon, Doctor Urquhart, but, really, blue-bells in October! Who ever
      heard of such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I have found them myself, in sheltered places, both the
      larger and smaller species; the one that grows from a single stem, and
      that which produces two or three bells from the same stalk&mdash;the
      campanula&mdash;shall I give you its botanical name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what you mean&mdash;<i>hare-bell</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue-bell; the real blue-bell of Scotland. What you call blue-bells are
      wild hyacinths.&rdquo; She shook her head with a pretty persistence. &ldquo;No, no; I
      have always called them blue-bells, and I always shall. Many a scolding
      have I got about them when I used, on cold March days, to steal a basket
      and a kitchen knife, to dig them up before the buds were formed, so as to
      transplant them safely in time to flower in my garden. Many's the knife I
      broke over that vain quest. Do you know how difficult it is to get at the
      bulb of a bluebell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wild hyacinth, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blue-bell,&rdquo; she laughingly persisted. &ldquo;I have sometimes picked out a
      fine one, growing in some easy soft mould, and undermined him, and worked
      round him, ten inches deep, fancying I had got to the root of him at last,
      when slip went the knife; and all was over. Many a time I have sat with
      the cut-off stalk in my hand, the long, white, slender stalk, ending in
      two delicate green leaves, with a tiny bud between&mdash;you know it; and
      actually cried, not only for vexation over lost labour, but because it
      seemed such a pity to have destroyed what one never could make alive
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said that, looking right into my face with her innocent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This girl, from her habit of speaking exactly as she thinks, and whether
      from her solitary country rearing, or her inate simplicity of character,
      thinking at once more naturally and originally than most women, will,
      doubtless, often say things like these.
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea once or twice this morning had flitted across my mind, whether it
      would not be better for me to break through my hermit ways, and allow
      myself to pay occasional visits among happy households, or the occasional
      society of good and cultivated women; now it altogether vanished. It would
      be a thing impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young lady must have very quick perceptions, and an accurate memory
      of trivial things, for, scarcely had she uttered the last words, when all
      her face was dyed crimson and red, as if she thought she had hurt or
      offended me. I judged it best to answer her thoughts out plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you that to kill wantonly even a flower is an evil deed. But
      you need not have minded saying that to me, even after our argument at the
      Cedars. I am not in your sense a soldier&mdash;a professed man-slayer, my
      vocation is rather the other way. Yet even for the former I could find
      arguments of defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, there are higher things than mere life, and greater crimes than
      taking it away? So I have been thinking myself, lately. You set me
      thinking, for the which I am glad to own myself your debtor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not a word of answer to this acknowledgment, at once frank and
      dignified. She went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I said foolish or rude things that night, you must remember how apt
      one is to judge from personal experience, and I have never seen any fair
      specimen of the army. Except,&rdquo; and her manner prevented all questioning of
      what duty elevated into a truth,&mdash;&ldquo;except, of course, Captain
      Treherne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, good people. Saying nothing bad of me, I hope? Anyhow, I leave my
      character in the hands of my friend Urquhart. He rates me soundly to my
      face, which is the best proof of his not speaking ill of me behind my
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is Doctor Urquhart's idea of friendship! bitter outside, and
      sweet at the core. What does he make of love, pray? All sweet and no
      bitter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or all bitter and no sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These speeches came from the two other sisters, the latter from the
      eldest; their flippancy needed no reply, and I gave none. The second
      sister was silent: which, I thought, shewed better taste, under the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes longer we sauntered on, leaving the wood and passing
      into the sunshine, which felt soft and warm as spring. Then there
      happened,&mdash;I have been slow in coming to it, one of those accidents,&mdash;trivial
      to all but me, which, whenever occurring, seem to dash the peaceful
      present out of my grasp, and, throw me back years&mdash;years, to the time
      when I had neither present nor future, but dragged on life, I scarcely
      know how, with every faculty tightly bound up in an inexorable,
      intolerable past.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was carrying her prayer-book, or Bible I think it was, though English
      people oftener carry to church prayer-books than Bibles, and seem to
      reverence them quite as much, or more. I had noticed it, as being not one
      of those velvet things with gilt crosses that ladies delight in, but
      plain-bound, with slightly soiled edges, as if with continual use. Passing
      through a gate, she dropped it: I stooped to pick it up, and there, on the
      fly-leaf, I saw written:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodora Johnston.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Johnston</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let me consider what followed, for my memory is not clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe, I walked with her to her own door, that there was a gathering
      and talking, which ended in Treherne's entering with the ladies, promising
      to overtake me before I reached the camp. That the gate closed upon them,
      and I heard their lively voices inside the garden wall while I walked
      rapidly down the road and back into the fir-wood. That gaining its shadow
      and shelter I sat down on a felled tree, to collect myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson her name is not, but <i>Johnston</i>. Spelt precisely the same as
      I remember noticing on his handkerchief, Johnston, without the final <i>e.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, granting that identity, it is still a not uncommon name; there are
      whole families, whole clans of Johnstons along the Scottish border, and
      plenty of English Johnstons and Johnstones likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I fighting with shadows, and torturing myself in vain? God grant it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, after this discovery, it is vitally necessary to learn more. I have
      sat up till midnight, waiting Treherne's return. He did not overtake me&mdash;I
      never expected he would&mdash;or desired it. I came back, when I did come
      back, another way. His hut, next to mine, is still silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So is the whole camp at this hour. Refreshing myself a few minutes since
      by standing bare-headed at my hut-door, I saw nothing but the stars
      overhead, and the long lines of lamps below; heard nothing but the sigh of
      the moorland wind, and the tramp of the sentries relieving guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must wait a little longer; to sleep would be impossible till I have
      tried to find out as much as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if it should be <i>that</i>&mdash;the worst? which might inevitably
      produce&mdash;or leave me no reason longer to defer&mdash;the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it seemed as if with long pondering my faculties became torpid. I
      fell into a sort of dream; which, being broken by a face looking in at me
      through the window, a sickness of perfectly childish terror came over me.
      For an instant only&mdash;and then I had put away my writing-materials and
      unbolted the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne came in, laughing violently. &ldquo;Why, Doctor, did you take me for a
      ghost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have been. You know what happened last week to those poor young
      fellows coming home from a dinner-party in a dogcart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George I do!&rdquo; The thought of this accident, which had greatly shocked
      the whole camp, sobered him at once. &ldquo;To be knocked over in action is one
      thing; but to die with one's head under a carriage-wheel&mdash;ugh!&mdash;Doctor,
      did ye really think something of the sort had befallen me? Thank you; I
      had no idea you cared so much for a harum-scarum fellow like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not be left believing an untruth; so I said, my startled looks
      were not on his account; the fact was, I had been writing closely for some
      hours, and was nervous&mdash;rather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion of my having &ldquo;nerves,&rdquo; afforded him considerable amusement.
      &ldquo;But that is just what Dora persisted&mdash;good sort of creature, isn't
      she? the one you walked with from church. I told her you were as strong as
      iron and as hard as a rock, and she said she didn't believe it; that yours
      was one of the most sensitive faces she had ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to Miss Theodora&mdash;I really was not aware of
      it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I either, faith! but women are so sharp-sighted. Ah, Doctor, you
      don't half know their ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I concluded he had stayed at Rockmount; had he spent a pleasant day?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant? ecstatic. Now, acknowledge&mdash;isn't she a glorious girl?
      Such a mouth&mdash;such an eye&mdash;such an arm! Altogether a magnificent
      creature. Don't you think so? Speak out, I shan't be jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, with truth, she was an extremely handsome young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome? Divine. But she's as lofty as a queen&mdash;won't allow any
      nonsense&mdash;I didn't get a kiss the whole day. She will have it we are
      not even engaged till I hear from the governor; and I can't get a letter
      till Tuesday, at soonest. Doctor, it's maddening. If all is not settled in
      a week, and that angel mine within six more&mdash;as she says she will be,
      parents consenting&mdash;I do believe it will drive me mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having her, or losing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either. She puts me nearly out of my senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down then, and put yourself into them again. For a few minutes, at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I perceived the young fellow was warm with something besides love. He
      had been solacing himself with wine and cigars in the mess-room.
      Intemperance was not one of his failings, nor was he more than a little
      excited now; not by any means what men consider &ldquo;overtaken,&rdquo; or, to use
      the honester and uglier word, &ldquo;drunk.&rdquo; Yet, as he stood there, lolling
      against the door, with hot cheeks and watery eyes, talking and laughing
      louder than usual, and diffusing an atmosphere both nicotian and
      alcoholic, I thought it was as well on the whole that his divinity did not
      see her too human young adorer. I have often pitied women, mothers, wives,
      sisters. If they could see some of us men as we often see one another!
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne talked rapturously of the family at Rockmount&mdash;the father
      and the three young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked if there were no mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Died, I believe, when my Lisabel was a baby. Lisabel; isn't it a
      pretty name? Lisabel Treherne, better still&mdash;beats Lisabel Johnston
      hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed an opportunity for questions, which must be put; safer put
      them now, than when Treherne was in a soberer and more observant mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnston is a Border name. Are they Scotch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge&mdash;I never inquired. Will, if you wish, doctor.
      You canny Scots always hang together, ha! ha!&mdash;but I say, did you
      ever see three nicer girls? Shouldn't you like one of them for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      I!
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;I am not a marrying man; but you will find them a
      pleasant family, apparently. Are there any more sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&mdash;quite enough, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor brothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the ghost of one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;&mdash;was it I, or some mocking imp speaking through my lips&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
      only the ghost of one. None now living, probably?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all that I ever heard of. So much the better; I shall have her
      more to myself. Heigho! it's an age till Tuesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better go to your bed, and shorten the time, by ten hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will. Night, night, old fellow&mdash;as they teach little brats to
      say, on disappearing from dessert.'Pon my life, I see myself the venerated
      head of a household, and pillar of the state already. You'll be quite
      proud of my exceeding respectability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his head in again, two minutes after, with a nod and a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, think better of it. Try for Miss Dora&mdash;the second. Charteris
      one, me the other, and you the third. What a jolly lot of brothers-in-law.
      Do think better of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, and go to your bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not possible to go to mine, till I had arranged my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he stated must be correct. If otherwise, it is next to impossible
      that, in his position of intimacy, he should not have heard it. Families
      do not, I suppose, so easily forget one who is lost. There must have been
      only those three daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may lay me down in peace. Thou who seest not as man sees, wilt Thou make
      it peace, even for me?

      CHAPTER VI. HER STORY.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hich means, &ldquo;shall
      Treherne have Lisa, and Lisa Treherne Court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is to be: I suppose it must be. Though not literally &ldquo;gone to be
      married,&rdquo; they are certainly &ldquo;going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For seven days the balance hung doubtful. I do not know exactly what
      turned the scale; sometimes a strong suspicion strikes me that it was
      Doctor Urquhart; but I have given up cogitating on the subject. Where one
      is utterly powerless&mdash;a mere iota in a house&mdash;when, whatever one
      might desire, one's opinion has not a straw's weight with anybody, what is
      the good of vexing one's self in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall content myself with giving a straightforward, succinct account of
      the week; this week which, I cannot deny, has made a vital difference in
      our family. Though outwardly all went on as usual&mdash;our quiet,
      monotonous life, unbroken by a single &ldquo;event,&rdquo;&mdash;breakfast, dinner,
      tea, and sleep coming round in ordinary rotation; still the change is
      made. What a long time it seems since Sunday week.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, after the tumult of Saturday, when I fairly shut myself up to
      escape out of the way, of both suitors, the coming and the going one,
      &mdash;sure that neither of my sisters would particularly want me&mdash;that
      Sunday was not a happy one. The only pleasant bit in it was the walk home
      from church; when, Penelope mounting guard over the lovers, I thought it
      no more than right to be civil to Dr. Urquhart. In so doing, I resolutely
      smothered down my annoyance at their joining us, and at the young
      gentleman's taking so much upon himself already, forsooth: lest Captain
      Treherne's friend should discover that I was not in the most amiable mood
      possible with regard to this marriage. And in so valorously &ldquo;putting
      myself into my pocket,&rdquo;&mdash;the had self which had been uppermost all
      day&mdash;somehow it slipped away as my pin-cushions and pencil-cases are
      wont to do&mdash;slid down to the earth and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed the walk. I like talking to Dr. Urquhart, for he seems honest.
      He makes one feel as if there were some solid good somewhere in the world,
      if only one could find it: instead of wandering among mere shams of it,
      pretences of heroism, simulations of virtue, selfish abortions of
      benevolence. It seems to me, at times, as if this present world were not
      unlike that place in Hades,&mdash;is it Dante's or Virgil's making?&mdash;where
      trees, beasts, ghosts, and all, are equally shadowy and unsubstantial.
      That Sunday morning, which happened to be a specially lovely one, was one
      of the few days lately, when things about me have seemed tangible and
      real. Including myself, who not seldom appear to myself as the biggest
      sham of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Urquhart left us at the gate: would not come in, though Penelope
      invited him. Indeed, he went away rather abruptly; I should say, rudely,&mdash;but
      that he is not the sort of man to be easily suspected of discourtesy.
      Captain Treherne declared his secession was not surprising, as he has a
      perfect horror of ladies' society. In which case, why did he not avoid
      mine? I am sure he need not have had it unless he chose: nor did he behave
      as if in a state of great martyrdom. Also, a lover of flowers is not
      likely to be a woman-hater, or a bad man, either: and those must be bad
      men who have an unqualified &ldquo;horror&rdquo; of women. I shall take the liberty,
      until further evidence, of doubting Captain Treherne&mdash;no novelty! The
      difficulty is to find any man in whom you can believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent Sunday afternoon chiefly in the garden, Lisabel and her lover
      strolling about together, as Penelope and Francis used to do. Penelope sat
      with me some time, on the terrace before the drawing-room windows; then
      bidding me stay where I was, and keep a look-out after those two, lest
      they should get too sentimental, she went indoors, and I saw her
      afterwards, through the parlour-window, writing&mdash;probably one of
      those long letters which Francis gets every Monday morning. What on earth
      can she find to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      The lecture against sentimentalism was needless. Nothing of that in
      Lisabel. Her courtship will be of the most matter-of-fact kind. Every time
      they passed me, she was talking or laughing. Not a soft or serious look
      has there been on her face since Friday night; or, rather, Saturday
      morning, when my sobbing made her shed a few tears. She did not
      afterwards,&mdash;not even when she told what has occurred to papa and
      Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope bore it well&mdash;if there was anything to bear, and perhaps
      there was&mdash;to her. It might be trying to have her youngest sister
      married first, and to a young man, but for whom Francis would himself long
      ago have been in a position to marry. He told us, on Saturday, the whole
      story: how, as a boy, he was meant for his uncle's heir, but late in life
      Sir William married. There was a coldness afterwards, till Mrs. Charteris
      died, when her brother got Francis this Government situation, from which
      we hoped so much, but which still continues, he says, &ldquo;a mere pittance.&rdquo;
       It is certainly rather hard for Francis. He had a long talk with papa,
      before he left, ending, as usual, in nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he went away, Penelope did not appear till tea-time, and was &ldquo;as
      cross as two sticks,&rdquo; to use a childish expression, all evening. If these
      are lover's visits, I heartily wish Francis would keep away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not in much better humour on Sunday, especially when, coming
      hastily into the parlour with a message from Lisabel, I gave her a start&mdash;for
      she was sitting, not writing, but leaning over her desk, with her fingers
      pressed upon her eyes. It startled me, too, to see her; we have grown so
      used to this affair, and Penelope is so sharp-tempered, that we never seem
      to suspect her of feeling anything. I was foolish enough to apologise for
      interrupting, and to attempt to kiss her, which irritated her so that we
      had almost a quarrel. I left the room, put on my bonnet, and went off to
      evening-church&mdash;God forgive me! for no better purpose than to get rid
      of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder, do sisters ever love one another? Not after our fashion, out of
      mere habit and long familiarity, also a certain pride, which, however we
      differ among ourselves, would make us, I believe, defend one another
      warmly against strangers&mdash;but out of voluntary sympathy and
      affection. Do families ever live in open-hearted union, feeling that blood
      is blood, closer than acquaintance, friendship, or any tie in the world,
      except marriage? That is, it ought to be. Perhaps it may so happen, once
      in a century, as true love does, or there would not be so much romancing
      about both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I meditated, as, rather sick and sorry at heart, I returned from
      church, tramping through the dark lanes after papa, who marched ahead,
      crunching the sand and dead leaves in his usual solid, solitary way, now
      and then calling out to me:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep close behind me. What a pity you came to church to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was foolish, but I think I could have cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, we found my sisters waiting tea. Captain Treherne was gone. They
      never mentioned to papa that he had been at Rock-mount to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, he did not make his appearance. I asked Lisabel if she had
      expected him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? I don't wish the young man to be always tied to my
      apron-strings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he might naturally want to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him want then. My dear little simpleton, it will do him good. The
      less he has me, the more he will value me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I observed that that was an odd doctrine with which to begin married life,
      but she laughed at me, and said the cases were altogether different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when Tuesday also passed, and no word from her adorer,
      Lisabel looked a little less easy. Not unhappy, our Lis was never seen
      unhappy since she was born, but just a little what we women call
      &ldquo;fidgety;&rdquo; a state of mind, the result of which generally affects other
      people rather than ourselves. In short, the mood for which, as children,
      we are whipped and sent to bed as &ldquo;naughty;&rdquo; as young women, petted, and
      pitied for &ldquo;low spirits;&rdquo; as elderly people, humoured on account of
      &ldquo;nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday morning when the post came, and brought no letter, Lisabel
      declared she would stay indoors no longer, but would go out for a drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the camp, as usual?&rdquo; said Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa laughed, and protested she should drive wherever she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls, will you come or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penelope declined, shortly. I said, I would go anywhere except to the
      camp, which I thought decidedly objectionable under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora, don't be silly. But do just as you like. I can call at the Cedars
      for Miss Emery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Colin too, who will be exceedingly happy to go with you,&rdquo; suggested
      Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sneer was wasted. Lisabel laughed again, smoothed her collar at
      the glass, and left the parlour, looking as contented as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere she went out, radiant in her new hat and feathers, her blue cloth
      jacket, and her dainty little driving-gloves (won in a bet with Captain
      Treherne), she put her head in at my door, where I was working at German,
      and trying to forget all these follies and annoyances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not go, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, and asked when she intended to be back?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably at lunch: or I may stay dinner at the Cedars. Just as it
      happens. Good bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisabel,&rdquo; I cried, catching her by the shoulders, &ldquo;what are you going to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you. Oh, take care of my feather! I shall drive over to the
      Cedars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any further? To the Camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends entirely upon circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you should meet him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Treherne? I shall bow politely, and drive on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if he comes here in your absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My compliments and regrets that unavoidable engagements deprived me of
      the pleasure of seeing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisabel, I don't believe you have a bit of heart in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have; quite as much as is convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mine was full, and she saw it. She patted me on the shoulder
      good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there ever was a dear little dolt, its name is Theodora Johnston. Why,
      child, at the worst, what harm am I doing? Merely showing a young fellow,
      who, I must say, is behaving rather badly, that I am not breaking my heart
      about him, nor mean to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you liked him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do; but not in your sentimental sort of way. I am a practical
      person. I told him, exactly as papa told him, that if he came with his
      father's consent, I would be engaged to him at once, and marry him as soon
      as he liked. Otherwise, let him go! That's all. Don't fret, child, I am
      quite able to take care of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly, she was! But I thought, if I were a man, I certainly should not
      trouble myself to go crazy after a woman,&mdash;if men ever do such a
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely was my sister gone, than I had the opportunity of considering
      that latter possibility. I was called downstairs to Captain Treherne.
      Never did I see an unfortunate youth in such a state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      What passed between us I cannot set down clearly; it was on his side so
      incoherent, on mine so awkward, and uncomfortable. I gathered that he had
      just had a letter from his father, refusing consent, or at least insisting
      on the delay of the marriage, which his friend Dr. Urquhart also advised.
      Exceedingly obliged to that gentleman for his polite interference in our
      family affairs, thought I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor lover seemed so much in earnest that I pitied him. Missing
      Lisabel, he had asked to see me, in order to know where she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him, to the Cedars. He turned as white as a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serves me right, serves me right, for my confounded folly and cowardice.
      I never will take anybody's advice again. What did she think of my keeping
      away so long? Did she despise&mdash;hate me?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said my sister had not confided to me any such opinion of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall not meet Granton, that fool&mdash;that knave&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;
      Could I overtake her before she reaches the Cedars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I informed him of a short cut across the moor, and he was out of the house
      in two minutes, before Penelope came into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope said I had done exceedingly wrong&mdash;that to send him after
      our Lisa, and allow her to be seen driving with him about the country, was
      the height of indecorum&mdash;that I had no sense of family dignity, or
      prudence, or propriety&mdash;was not a woman at all, but a mere
      sentimental hookworm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered, I was glad of it, if to be a woman was to resemble the women I
      knew best.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bitter, wicked speech, bitterly repented of when uttered. Penelope has a
      sharp tongue, though she does not know it; but when she rouses mine, I do
      know it, therefore am the more guilty. Many an unkind or sarcastic word
      that women drop, as carelessly as a minute seed, often fructifies into a
      whole garden-full of noisome weeds, sprung up,&mdash;they have forgotten
      how,&mdash;but the weeds are there. Yet still I cannot always command my
      tongue. Even, sometimes, when I do, the effort makes me think all the more
      angrily of Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not now in an angry, but a humbled spirit, that, when Penelope was
      gone to her district visiting&mdash;she does far more in the parish than
      either Lis or I&mdash;I went out alone, as usual, upon the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      My moorlands looked dreary; the heather is fading from purple to brown;
      the Autumn days are coming on fast. That afternoon they had that leaden
      uniformity which always weighs me down; I felt weary, hopeless&mdash;longed
      for some change in my dull life; wished I were a boy, a man&mdash;anything,
      so that I might be something&mdash;do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus thinking, so deeply that I noticed little, a person overtook, and
      passed me. It is so rare to meet anyone above the rank of a labourer
      hereabouts, that I looked round; and then saw it was Dr. Urquhart. He
      recognised me, apparently&mdash;mechanically I bowed, so did he, and went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This broke the chain of my thoughts&mdash;they wandered to my sister,
      Captain Treherne, and this Dr. Urquhart, with whom, now I came to think of
      it&mdash;I had not done so in the instant of his passing&mdash;I felt
      justly displeased. What right had he to meddle with my sister's affairs&mdash;to
      give his sage advice to his obedient young friend, who was foolish enough
      to ask it? Would I marry a man who went consulting his near, dear, and
      particular friends as to whether they were pleased to consider me a
      suitable wife for him? Never! Let him out of his own will love me, choose
      me, and win me, or leave me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, perhaps, the blame lay more at Mr. Treherne's door than his friend's&mdash;whom
      I could not call either a bad man or a designing man&mdash;his countenance
      forbade it. Surely I had been unjust to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have known this, and wished to give me a chance of penitence, for
      I shortly saw his figure reappearing over the slope of the road, returning
      towards me. Should I go back? But that would seem too pointed, and we
      should only exchange another formal bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was mistaken. He stopped, bade me &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; made some remarks
      about the weather, and then abruptly told me that he had taken the liberty
      of turning back because he wanted to speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought, whatever will Penelope say! This escapade will be more
      &ldquo;improper&rdquo; than Lisabel's, though my friend is patriarchal in his age and
      preternatural in his gravity. But the mischievous spirit, together with a
      little uncomfortable surprise, went out of me when I looked at Dr.
      Urquhart. In spite of himself, his whole manner was so exceedingly nervous
      that I became quite myself, if only out of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I presume on our acquaintance enough to ask you a question&mdash;simple
      enough, but of great moment to me. Is Captain Treherne at your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been there to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, you think me extremely impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not impertinent, but more inquisitive than I consider justifiable in a
      stranger. I really cannot engage to answer any more questions concerning
      my family or acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I beg your pardon. I will wish you good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too candid yourself not to permit candour in me&mdash;may I, in
      excuse, state my reasons for thus interrupting you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that I know, and have known all along, the present
      relations of my friend Treherne with your family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather not discuss that subject, Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it will account for my asking questions about Captain Treherne.
      He left me this morning in a state of the greatest excitement. And at his
      age, with his temperament, there is no knowing to what a young man may not
      be driven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, I believe, to nothing worse than the Cedars, with my sister
      as his charioteer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are satirical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exceedingly obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Urquhart regarded me with a sort of benignant smile, as if I were a
      naughty child, whose naughtiness partly grieved, and partly amused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, in warrant of my age and my profession, you will allow me a few words
      of serious conversation with you, I, in my turn, shall be exceedingly
      obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if I speak about your sister and Captain Treherne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he roused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, I do not see that you have the slightest right to
      interfere about my sister and Captain Treherne. He may choose to make you
      his confidant&mdash;I shall not: and I think very meanly of any man who
      brings a third person, either as umpire or go-between, betwixt himself and
      the woman he professes to love.&rdquo; Doctor Urquhart looked at me again
      fixedly, with that curious, half-melancholy smile, before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, let me beg of you to believe one thing&mdash;I am not that
      go-between.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so very gentle with me in my wrath, that, perforce, I could not be
      angry. I turned homeward, and he turned with me; but I was determined not
      to give him another syllable. Nevertheless, he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since we have said thus much, may I be allowed one word more? This matter
      has begun to give me extreme uneasiness. It is doing Treherne much harm.
      He is an only son, the son of his father's old age: on him much hope
      rests. He is very young&mdash;I never knew him to be serious in anything
      before. He is serious in his attachment&mdash;I mean in his ardent desire
      to marry your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? We are deeply indebted to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady, when we are talking on a matter so important, and
      which concerns you so nearly, it is a pity to reply in that tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be reproved in this way by a man and a stranger! I was so astonished
      that it made me dumb. He continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that, for the present, Sir William's consent has been
      refused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And indignant, probably. Yet there are two sides to the subject. It is
      rather trying to an old man, when his son writes suddenly, and insists
      upon bringing home a daughter-in-law, however charming, in six weeks;
      natural, too, that the father should urge,&mdash;'Take time to consider,
      my dear boy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, should he go further, and wish some information respecting the lady
      who is to become one of his family&mdash;desire to know her family, in
      order to judge more of one on whom are to depend his son's happiness and
      his house and honour, you would not think him unjust or tyrannical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. We,&rdquo; I said, with some pride, alas! more pride than truth,
      &ldquo;we should exact the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Sir William, well, and he trusts me. You will, perhaps, understand
      how this trust and the&mdash;the flexible character of his son, make me
      feel painfully responsible. Also, I know what youth is when thwarted. If
      that young fellow should go wrong, it would be to me&mdash;you cannot
      conceive how painful it would be to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hands nervously working one over the other, the sorrowful expression
      of his eyes, indicated sufficient emotion to make me extremely grieved for
      this good-hearted man. I am sure he is good-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I could not, of course, feel the same interest that he did in
      Captain Treherne, but that I wished the young man well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me one thing; is your sister really attached to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sudden question, which I had so many times asked of myself&mdash;ought
      I to reply to it? Could I? Only by a prevarication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Treherne is the best person from whom to obtain that information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I began to walk quicker, as a hint that this very odd conversation had
      lasted quite long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not detain you two minutes,&rdquo; my companion said, hastily. &ldquo;It is a
      strange confidence to put in you, and yet I feel I may. Sir William wrote
      to me privately today. On my answer to his enquiries his consent will
      mainly depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want to know? If we are respectable; if we have any money;
      if we have been decently educated, so that our connection shall not
      disgrace his family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are almost justified in being angry; but I said nothing of the kind.
      His questions only referred to the personal worth of the lady, and her
      personal attachment to his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Lisa! That she should have her character asked for like a
      housemaid! That she should be admitted into a grand family,
      condescendingly, on sufferance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You quite mistake,&rdquo; said Doctor Urquhart, earnestly. &ldquo;You are so angry,
      that you will not listen to what I say. Sir William is wealthy enough to
      be indifferent to money. Birth and position he might desire, and his son
      has already satisfied him upon yours; that your father is a clergyman, and
      that you come of an old English family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not; we come of nothing and nobody. My grandfather was a farmer; he
      wrote his name Johnson, plain, plebeian Johnson. We are, by right, no
      Johnstons at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The awful announcement had not the effect I anticipated. True, Doctor
      Urquhart started a little, and walked on silently for some minutes, but
      when he turned his face round it was quite beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did tell this to Sir William, he is too honourable a man not to
      value honour and honesty in any family, whether plebeian, as you call it,
      or not. Pardon me this long intrusion, with all my other offences. Will
      you shake hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We did so&mdash;quite friendly, and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Lisabel at home. By some chance, she had missed the Grantons, and
      Captain Treherne had missed her; I know not of which accident I was the
      most glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly and plainly, as seemed to me best, I told her of my meeting Doctor
      Urquhart, and of all that had passed between us; saving only the fact of
      Sir William's letter to him, which, as he said it was &ldquo;in confidence,&rdquo; I
      felt I was not justified in communicating even to my sister.,
    </p>
    <p>
      She took everything very easily&mdash;laughed at Mr. Treherne's woes,
      called him &ldquo;poor fellow,&rdquo; was sure all would come right in time, and went
      upstairs to dress for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday she got a letter from him which she gave me to read&mdash;very
      passionate, and full of nonsense. I wonder any man can write such rubbish,
      or any woman care to read it&mdash;still more to show it. It gave no
      information on facts&mdash;only implored her to see him; which, in a neat
      little note, also given for my perusal, Lisabel declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday evening, just after the lamp was lit and we were all sitting
      round the tea-table, who should send in his card with a message begging a
      few minutes' conversation with Mr. Johnston, but Doctor Urquhart? &ldquo;Max
      Urquhart, M.D.&rdquo;&mdash;as his card said. How odd he should be called &ldquo;Max.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa, roused from his nap, desired the visitor to be shown in, and with
      some difficulty I made him understand that this was the gentleman Mrs.
      Granton had spoken of&mdash;also&mdash;as Penelope added ill-naturedly,
      &ldquo;the particular friend of Captain Treherne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This&mdash;for though he has said nothing, I am sure he has understood
      what has been going on&mdash;made papa stand up rather frigidly when
      Doctor Urquhart entered the parlour. He did so, hesitatingly, as if coming
      out of the dark night, the blaze of our lamp confused him. I noticed he
      put his hand to shade his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, I believe Mrs. Granton's friend, and Captain
      Treherne's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be seated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a chair opposite; and he and papa scanned one another closely. I
      caught, in Dr. Urquhart's face, that peculiar uneasy expression about the
      mouth. What a comfort a beard must be to a nervous person!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few commonplace remarks passed, and then our visitor asked if he might
      speak with papa alone. He was the bearer of a message&mdash;a letter in
      short&mdash;from Sir William Treherne, of Treherne Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa said, stiffly&mdash;he had not the honour of that gentleman's
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir William hopes, nevertheless, to have the honour of making yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel pinched me under the table; Penelope gazed steadily into the
      tea-pot; papa rose and walked solemnly into his study&mdash;Doctor
      Urquhart following.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was&mdash;as Lisa cleverly expressed it&mdash;&ldquo;all right.&rdquo; All parties
      concerned had given full consent to the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Treherne came the day following to Rockmount, in a state of
      exuberant felicity, the overplus of which he vented in kissing Penelope
      and me, and requesting us to call him &ldquo;Augustus.&rdquo; I am afraid I could
      willingly have dispensed with either ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart, we have not seen again&mdash;he was not at church
      yesterday. Papa intends to invite him to dinner shortly. He says he likes
      him very much.

      CHAPTER VII. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ospital-work,
      rather heavy this week, with other things of lesser moment, have stopped
      this my correspondence with an airy nothing however, the blank will not be
      missed&mdash;nought concerning Max Urquhart would be missed by anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardon, fond and faithful Nobody, for whose benefit I write, and for whose
      good opinion I am naturally anxious. I believe two or three people would
      miss me, my advice and conversation, in the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the bye, Thomas Hardman, to my extreme satisfaction, seems really
      reforming. His wife told me he has not taken a drop too much since he came
      out of hospital. She says this illness was the saving of him, since, if he
      had been flogged, or discharged for drunkenness, he would have been a
      drunkard all his days. So far, so good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was writing about being missed, literally, by Nobody. And, truly, this
      seems fair enough; for is there anybody I should miss? Have I missed, or
      been relieved by the lost company of my young friend who has so long
      haunted my hut, but who, now, at an amazing expense in carriage-hire,
      horse-flesh, and shoe-leather, manages to spend every available minute at
      a much more lively abode, as Rockmount probably is, for he seems to find a
      charm in the very walls which enclose his jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I prefer the casket to the gem. Rockmount must be a pleasant
      house to live in; I thought so the first night, when, by Sir William's
      earnest desire, I took upon myself the part of &ldquo;father&rdquo; to that wilful
      lad, and paid the preliminary visit to the lady's father, Mr. Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson it is, properly, as I learnt from that impetuous young daughter of
      his, when, meeting her on the moor, the idea suddenly struck me to gain
      from her some knowledge that might guide my conduct in the very anxious
      position wherein I was placed. Johnson, only Johnson. Poor child! had she
      known the load she lifted off me by those few impetuous words, which
      accident only won; for Treherne's matter, had for once driven out of my
      mind all other thoughts, or doubts, or fears, which may now henceforward
      be completely set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must, of course, take no notice of her frank communication, but continue
      to call them &ldquo;Johnston.&rdquo; Families which &ldquo;come from nothing and nobody&rdquo;&mdash;the
      foolish lassie! as if we did not all come alike from Father Adam;&mdash;are
      very tenacious on these points; which may have their Value&mdash;to
      families. Unto isolated individuals they seem ridiculous. To me, for
      instance, of what benefit is it to bear an ancient name, bequeathed by
      ancestors whom I owe nothing besides, and which I shall leave to no
      descendants. I, who have no abiding place on the whole earth, and to whom,
      as I read in a review extract yesterday, &ldquo;My home is any room where I can
      draw a bolt across the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of home, I revert to my first glimpse of the interior of
      Rockmount, that rainy night, when, weary with my day and night journey,
      and struck more than ever with the empty dreariness of Treherne Court, and
      the restlessness of its poor gouty old master, able to enjoy so little out
      of all his splendours, I suddenly entered this snug little &ldquo;home.&rdquo; The
      fire, the tea-table, the neatly-dressed daughters, looking quite different
      from decked-out beauties, or hospital slatterns, which are the two phases
      in which I most often see the sex. Certainly, to one who has been much
      abroad, there is a great charm in the sweet looks of a thorough English
      woman by her own fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      This picture fixed itself on my mind, distinct as a photograph; for truly
      it was printed in light. The warm, bright parlour, with a delicate-tinted
      paper, a flowered carpet, and amber curtains, which I noticed because one
      of the daughters was in the act of drawing them, to screen the draught
      from her father's arm-chair. The old man&mdash;he must be seventy, nearly&mdash;standing
      on the hearth-rug, met me coldly enough, which was not surprising, prior
      to our conversation. The three ladies I have before named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, the future Mrs. Treherne is by far the handsomest; but I still
      prefer the countenance of my earliest acquaintance, Miss Theodora&mdash;a
      pretty name. Neither she nor her sisters gave me more than a formal bow;
      shaking hands is evidently not their custom with strangers. I should have
      thought of that, two days before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnston took me into his study. It is an antique room, with dogs for
      the fire-place, and a settle on either side the hearth; many books or
      papers about, and a large, neatly-arranged library on shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed these things, because, as I say, my long absence from England
      caused them to attract me more than they might have done a person
      accustomed to English domestic life. That old man, gliding peacefully
      down-hill in the arms of his three daughters, was a sight pleasant enough.
      There must be many compensations in old age&mdash;in such an old age as
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnston&mdash;I am learning to write the name without hesitation&mdash;is
      not a man of many words. His character appears to me of that type which I
      have generally found associated with those specially delicate and regular
      features; shrinking from anything painful or distasteful, putting it
      aside, forgetting it, if possible, but anyhow trying to get rid of it.
      Thus, when I had delivered Sir William Treherne's most cordial and
      gentlemanly letter, and explained his thorough consent to the marriage,
      the lady's father took it much more indifferently than I had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, &ldquo;that he had never interfered with his daughters' choice in such
      matters, nor should he now; he had no objection to see them settled; they
      would have no protector when he was gone.&rdquo; And here he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered, it was a very natural parental desire, and I trusted Captain
      Treherne would prove a good brother to the Misses Johnston, as well as a
      good son to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he said, hastily, and then asked me a few questions as to
      Treherne's prospects, temper, and moral character, which I was glad to be
      able to answer as I did. &ldquo;Harum-scarum&rdquo; as I call him&mdash;few young men
      of fortune can boast a more stainless life, and so I told Mr. Johnston. He
      seemed satisfied, and ended our interview by saying, &ldquo;that he should be
      happy to see the young gentleman to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I departed, declining his invitation to re-enter the drawing-room, for
      it seemed that, at the present crisis in their family history, there was
      an indelicacy in any strangers breaking in upon that happy circle.
      Otherwise, I would have liked well another peep at the pretty
      home-picture, which, in walking to the camp through a pelting rain,
      flitted before my eyes again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne was waiting in my hut. He looked up, fevered with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil have you been gone to, Doctor? Nobody has known anything
      about you for the last two days. And I wanted you to write to the
      governor, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen the &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; as you will persist in calling the best of
      fathers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Rockmount father too. Go in and win, my boy; the coast's all
      clear. Mind you ask me to the wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly there is a certain satisfaction in having had ar hand in making
      young folks happy. The sight does not happen often enough to afford my
      smiling even at the demonstrations of that poor lad on this memorable
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have left him to his own devices, and followed mine, which
      have little to do with happy people. Once or twice, I have had business
      with Mr. Granton, who does not seem to suffer acutely at Miss Lisabel's
      marriage. He need not cause a care, even to that tender-hearted damsel,
      who besought me so pitifully to take him in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, I trust the whole Rockmount family are happy, and fulfilling their
      destiny&mdash;in the which, little as I thought it, when I stood watching
      the solitary girl in the sofa corner, Max Urquhart has been made more an
      instrument than he ever dreamed of, or than they are likely ever to be
      aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was beginning to fade out of my memory, as one of the many
      episodes which are always occurring to create passing interests in a
      doctor's life, when I received an invitation to dine at Rockmount.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dislike accepting casual invitations. Primarily, on principle&mdash;the
      bread-and-salt doctrine of the East, which considers hospitality neither
      as a business nor an amusement, but as a sacred rite, entailing permanent
      responsibility to both host and guest. When I sit by a man's fireside, or
      (Treherne <i>loquitur</i>) &ldquo;put my feet under his mahogany,&rdquo; I feel bound
      not merely to give him back the same quantity and quality of meat and
      drink, but to regard myself as henceforth his friend and guest, under
      obligations closer and more binding than one would submit to from the
      world in general. It is, therefore, incumbent on me to be very choice in
      those with whom I put myself under such bonds and obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My secondary reasons are so purely personal, that they will not bear
      enlarging upon. Most people of solitary life, and conscious of many
      peculiarities, take small pleasure in general society, otherwise to go out
      into the world, to rub up one's intellect, enlarge one's social
      sympathies, enjoy the commingling of wit, learning, beauty, and even
      folly, would be a pleasant thing&mdash;like sitting to watch a pyrotechnic
      display, knowing all the while, that when it was ended one could come back
      to see one's heart in the perennial warmth of one's own fireside. If not,&mdash;better
      stay away:&mdash;for one is inclined to turn cynical, and perceive nothing
      but the smell of the gunpowder, the wrecks of the catherine-wheels, and
      the empty shells of the Roman-candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rockmount invitation was rather friendly than formal, and it came from
      an old man. The feeble hand-writing, the all but illegible signature,
      weighed with me, in spite of myself. I had no definite reason to refuse
      his politeness, which is not likely to extend beyond an occasional
      dinner-party, of the sort given hereabouts periodically, to middle aged
      respectable neighbours&mdash;in which category may be supposed to come Max
      Urquhart, M.D. I accepted the courtesy and invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, let me confess to thee, compassionate unknown, the ridiculous
      hesitation with which I walked up to this friendly door, from which I
      should certainly have walked away again, but for my dislike to break any
      engagement, however trivial, or even a promise made only to myself. Let me
      own the morbid dread with which I contemplated four mortal hours to be
      spent in the society of a dozen friendly people, made doubly sociable by
      the influence of a good dinner, and the best of wines.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the alarm was needless, as a little common sense, had I exercised it,
      would soon have proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room, lit with the warm duskiness of firelight, sat the
      three ladies. The eldest received me politely: the youngest
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are only ourselves, you see; we understand you dislike dinner-parties,
      so we invited nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never do give dinner-parties more than once or twice a-year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the second daughter who made that last remark. I thought whether it
      was for my sake or her own, that one young lady had taken the trouble to
      give me a false impression, and the other to remove it. And how very
      indifferent I was to both attempts! Surely, women hold trifles of more
      moment than we men can afford to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious enough to me was the thoroughly feminine atmosphere of the dainty
      little drawing-room, set out, not with costly splendours, like Treherne
      Court, but pretty home-made ornaments, and, above all, with plenty of
      flowers. My olfactories are acute; certain rooms always possess to me
      certain associated scents through which, at whatever distance of time I
      revisit them, the pristine impression survives; sometimes pleasant,
      sometimes horribly painful. That pretty parlour will, I fancy, always
      carry to me the scent of orange-flowers. It came through the door of a
      little greenhouse, from a tree there, the finest specimen I had yet seen
      in England, and I rose to examine it. There followed me the second
      daughter, Miss Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the minute picture which I have been making of my evening at Rockmount,
      I ought not to omit this young girl, or young woman, for she appears both
      by turns; indeed, she has the most variable exterior of any person I ever
      met. I recall her successively; the first time of meeting, quite
      child-like in her looks and ways; the second, sedate and womanly, save in
      her little obstinacy about the blue-bells; the third, dignified,
      indignant, pertinaciously reserved; but this night I saw her in an
      entirely new character, neither childish nor woman-like, but altogether
      gentle and girlish&mdash;a thorough English girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dress, of some soft, dark colour, which fell in folds, and did not
      rustle or spread; her hair, which was twisted at the back, without any
      bows or laces, such as I see ladies wear, and brought down, smooth and
      soft over the forehead, formed a sufficient contrast to her sisters to
      make me notice her; besides, it was a style more according to my own
      taste. I hate to see a woman all flounces and filligigs, or with her hair
      torn up by the roots like a Chinese Mandarin. Hair, curved over the brow
      like a Saxon arch, under the doorway of which two modest intelligent eyes
      stand sentinel, vouching for the worth of' what is within&mdash;grant
      these, and the rest of the features may be anything you choose, if not
      absolutely ugly. The only peculiarity about hers was, a squareness of
      chin, and closeness of mouth, indicating more strength than sweetness of
      disposition, until the young lady smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing this, I am smiling myself, to reflect how little people would give
      me credit for so much observation; but a liking to study character is,
      perhaps, of all others, the hobby most useful to a medical man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have left my object of remark all this while, standing by her
      orange-tree, and contemplating a large caterpillar slowly crawling over
      one of its leaves. I recommended her to get Treherne to smoke in her
      conservatory, which would remove the insects from her flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not mine, I rarely pay them the least attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought she was fond of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but wild flowers, not tame, like these of Penelope's. I only
      patronise those she throws away as being not 'good.' Can you imagine
      mother Nature making a 'bad' flower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, I concluded Miss Johnston was a scientific horticulturist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed she is. I never knew a girl so learned about flowers,
      well-educated, genteel, greenhouse flowers, as our Penelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our&rdquo; Penelope. There must be a pleasure in these family possessive
      pronouns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the honour of taking into dinner this lady, who is very sprightly,
      with nothing at all Odyssean about her. During a lack of conversation, for
      Treherne, of course, devoted himself to his ladye-love; and Mr. Johnston
      is the most silent of hosts, I ventured to remark that this was the first
      time I had ever met a lady with that old Greek name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope!&rdquo; cried Treherne. &ldquo;'Pon my life I forget who was Penelope. Do
      tell us, Dora. That young lady knows everything, Doctor; a regular
      blue-stocking; at first she quite frightened me, I declare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Treherne seems to be making himself uncommonly familiar with his
      future sisters-in-law. This one did not exactly relish it, to judge by her
      look. She has a will of her own, and a temper, too, &ldquo;that young lady.&rdquo; It
      is as well Treherne did not happen to set his affections upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor youth! he never knows when to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I have it now, Miss Dora. Penelope was in the Odyssey&mdash;that book
      of engravings you were showing my cousin Charteris and me that Friday
      night. And how I laughed at what Charteris said&mdash;that he thought the
      good lady was very much over-rated, and Ulysses in the right of it to ride
      away again, when, coming back after ten years, he found her a prudish,
      psalm-singing, spinning old woman. Hollo!&mdash;have I put my foot into
      it, Lisabel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed so, by the constrained silence of the whole party. Miss Johnston
      turned scarlet, and then white, but immediately said to me, laughing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Charteris is an excellent classic; he was papa's pupil for some
      years. Have you ever met him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not, but I had often heard of him in certain circles of our camp
      society, as well as from Sir William Treherne. And I now suddenly
      recollected that, in talking over his son's marriage, the latter had
      expressed some surprise at the news Treherne had given, that this gay
      bachelor about town, whose society he had been always chary of cultivating
      for fear of harm to &ldquo;the boy,&rdquo; had been engaged for some time to a member
      of the Johnston family. This was, of course, Miss Johnston&mdash;Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have let the subject drop, but Miss Lisabel revived it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have heard a deal about Francis? No wonder!&mdash;-is he not a
      charming person?&mdash;and very much thought of in London society? Do tell
      us all you heard about him?&rdquo; Treherne gave me a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you'll never get anything out of the Doctor. He knows everybody, and
      everybody tells him everything, but there it ends. He is a perfect tomb&mdash;a
      sarcophagus of silence, as a fellow once called him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lisabel held up her hands, and vowed she was really afraid of me.
      Miss Johnston said, sharply, &ldquo;She liked candid people: a sarcophagus of
      silence implied a 'body' inside.&rdquo; At which all laughed, except the second
      sister, who said, with some warmth, &ldquo;She thought there were few qualities
      more rare and valuable than the power of keeping a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Dora thinks so. Doctor, my sister, there, is the most
      secretive little mouse that ever was born. Red-hot pincers could not force
      from her what she did not choose to tell, about herself or other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I well believe that. One sometimes finds that combination of natural
      frankness, and exceeding reticence, when reticence is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; had justified her name by being silent nearly all dinner-time,
      though it was not the silence of either sullenness or abstraction. But
      when she was afterwards accused of delighting in a secret, &ldquo;running away
      with it, and hiding it in her hole, like a bit of cheese,&rdquo; she looked up,
      and said, emphatically:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a mistake, Lisabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fib, you mean. Augustus, do you know my sisters call me a dreadful
      story-teller,&rdquo; smiling at him, as if she thought it the best joke in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, a mistake, and meant nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us, child, what you really meant, if it is possible to get it out
      of you,&rdquo; observed the eldest sister; and the poor &ldquo;mouse,&rdquo; thus driven
      into a corner, looked round the table with those bright eyes of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisabel mistakes; I do not delight in secrets. I think people ought not
      to have any, but to be of one mind in a house.&rdquo; (She studies her Bible,
      then, for the phrase came out as naturally as one quotes habitual phrases,
      scarcely conscious whence one has learned them). &ldquo;Those who really care
      for one another, are much happier when they tell one another everything;
      there is nothing so dangerous as a secret. Better never have one, but,
      having it, if one ought to keep it at all, one ought to keep it to the
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked&mdash;quite accidentally, I do believe&mdash;but still she
      looked at me. Why is it, that this girl should be the instrument of giving
      me continual stabs of pain: yet there is a charm in them. They take away a
      little of the feeling of isolation&mdash;the contrast between the inside
      and outside of the sarcophagus. Many true words are spoken in jest! They
      dart, like a thread of light, even to &ldquo;the body&rdquo; within. Corruption has
      its laws. I marvel in what length of time might a sun-beam, penetrating
      there, find nothing worse than harmless dust?
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will pass into ordinary life again. Common sense teaches a man in my
      circumstances that this is the best thing for him. What business has he to
      set himself up as a Simon Stylites on a solitary column of woe? as if
      misery constituted saintship? There is no arrogance like the hypocrisy of
      humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Treherne had joined the ladies, Mr. Johnston and myself started some
      very interesting conversation, <i>à propos</i> of Mrs. Granton and her
      doings in the parish, when I found that he has the feeling, very rare
      among country gentlemen of his age and generation&mdash;an exceeding
      aversion for strong drinks. He discountenances Father Mathew and the
      pledge as popish, a crotchet not surprising in an old Tory, whose
      opinions, never wide, all run in one groove, as it were; but he advocates
      temperance, even to teetotalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to draw the line of moderation, and argued that, because some men,
      determined on making beasts of themselves, required to be treated like
      beasts, by compulsion only; that was no reason why the remainder should
      not have free-will, man's glorious privilege, to prove their manhood by
      the choice of good or evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Adam&mdash;and Adam fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a Greater than Adam; trusting in Whom, we need never fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man did not reply, but he looked much excited. The subject seemed
      to rouse in him something beyond the mere disgust of an educated
      gentleman, at what offended his refined tastes. Had not certain other
      reasons made that solution improbable, I could have imagined it the
      shudder of one too familiar with the vice he now abhorred: that he spoke
      about drunkenness with the terrified fierceness of one who had himself
      been a drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat talking across the table, philosophically, abstractedly, yet
      with a perceptible undertone of reserve,&mdash;I heard it in his voice; I
      felt it in my own,&mdash;or listening silently to the equinoctial gale,
      which rattled the window, made the candles flicker, almost caused the wine
      to shake in the untouched decanters&mdash;as I have heard table-rapping
      tales, of wine beginning to shake when there was &ldquo;a spirit present,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      thought struck me more than once&mdash;if either of us two men could lift
      the curtain from one another's past, what would be found there?
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to close our conversation, by saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand now, Doctor Urquhart, and I wish to name it as a sort
      of apology for former close questioning, my extreme horror of drunkenness,
      and my satisfaction at finding that Mr. Treherne has no propensity in this
      direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; that, with all the temptations of a mess-table, to take
      much wine was, with him, a thing exceedingly rare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rare! I thought you said he never drank at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said he was no drunkard, nor at all in the habit of drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Habits grow, we know not how,&rdquo; cried the old man, irritably. &ldquo;Does he
      take it every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Most military men do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnston turned sharp upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have no modifications, Doctor Urquhart. Can you declare positively
      that you never saw Captain Treherne the worse for liquor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To answer this question directly was impossible. I tried to remove the
      impression I had unfortunately given, and which the old man had taken up
      so unexpectedly and fiercely, by enlarging on the brave manner in which
      Treherne had withstood many a lure to evil ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot deceive me, sir. I must have the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was on the point of telling him to seek it from Treherne himself, when,
      remembering the irritation of the old man, and the hotheaded imprudence of
      the young one, I thought it would be safer to bear the brunt myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I informed Mr. Johnston of the two only instances when I had seen Treherne
      not himself. Once after twenty-four hours in the trenches, when unlimited
      brandy could hardly keep life in our poor fellows, and again when Miss
      Lisabel herself must be his excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisabel? Do not name her. Sir, I would rather see a daughter of mine in
      her grave, than the wife of a drunkard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, allow me to assert, Captain Treherne is not, and is never likely
      to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnston shook his head incredulously. I became more and more
      convinced about the justness of my conjecture about his past life, which
      delicacy forbade me to enquire into, or to use as any argument against his
      harshness now. I began to feel seriously uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Johnston,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;would you for this accidental error&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused, seeing at the door a young lady's face, Miss Theodora's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, tea is waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it wait then: shut the door. Well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I repeated, would he, for one accidental error, condemn the young man
      entirely?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has condemned himself; he has taken the first step, and his downward
      course will be swift and sudden. There is no stopping it, sir,&rdquo; and he
      struck his hand on the table. &ldquo;If I had a son, and he liked wine, as a
      child does, perhaps; a pretty little boy, sitting at table and drinking
      healths at birthdays, or a schoolboy, proud to do what he sees his father
      doing,&mdash;I would take his glass from him, and fill it with poison,
      deadly poison&mdash;that he might kill himself at once, rather than grow
      up to be his friends' and his own damnation&mdash;a <i>drunkard</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I urged, after a minute's pause, that Treherne was neither a child nor a
      boy; that he had passed through the early perils of youth, and succumbed
      to none; that there was little fear he would ever become a drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please God, he never shall! Even if he had yielded to temptation; if,
      even in your sense, and mine, Mr. Johnston, the young man had once been
      'drunk,' should he for that be branded as a hopeless drunkard? I think not&mdash;I
      trust not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, strongly excited myself, I pleaded for the lad as if I had been
      pleading for my own life,&mdash;but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting late, and I was in momentary dread of another summons to
      the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases like these there comes a time when, be our opponents younger or
      older, inferior or superior to ourselves, we feel we must assert what we
      believe to be right, &ldquo;taking the upper hand,&rdquo; as it is called; that is,
      using the power which the few have in guiding the many. Call it influence,
      decision, will,&mdash;one who possesses that quality rarely gets through
      half a lifetime without discovering the fact, and what a weighty and
      solemn gift it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said to Mr. Johnston, very respectfully, yet resolutely, that, in so
      serious a matter, of which I myself was the unhappy cause, I must request
      him, as a personal favour, to postpone his decision for to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;forgive my urging that, both as a father and a
      clergyman, you are bound to be careful how you decide. By one fatal word
      you may destroy your daughter's happiness for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw him start; I struck bolder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, as Captain Treherne's friend, let me remind you that he has a
      future, too. It is a dangerous thing for a young man's future when he is
      thwarted in his first love. What if he should go all wrong, and you had to
      answer to Sir William Treherne for the ruin of his only son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not prepared for the effect of my words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His only son&mdash;God forgive me! is he his only son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnston turned from me; his hands shook violently, his whole
      countenance changed. In it there was as much remorse and anguish as if he,
      in his youth, had been some old man's only and perhaps erring son.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could pity him&mdash;if he were one of those who suffer to their life's
      end for the evil deeds of their youth. I abstained from any further
      remarks, and he made none. At last, as he expressed some wish to be left
      alone, I rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;I will thank you not to name
      this conversation to my family. For the subject of it&mdash;we'll pass it
      over&mdash;this once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and earnestly begged forgiveness for any warmth I had shown
      in the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, oh yes! Did I not say we would pass it over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank wearily back in his arm-chair, but I felt the point was gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of the evening, when Treherne and Miss Lisabel, in happy
      ignorance of all the peril their bliss had gone through, were making
      believe to play chess in the corner, and Miss Johnston was reading the
      newspaper to her father, I slipped away to the green-house, where I stood
      examining some orchids, and thinking how curious it was that I, a perfect
      stranger, should be so mixed up with the private affairs of this family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soft as the whisper was, it made me start. I apologised for not having
      seen Miss Theodora enter, and began admiring the orchidaceous plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very pretty. But I wanted to ask you, what were you and papa talking
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father wished me not to mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I heard part of it, I could not help hearing,&mdash;and I guessed the
      rest. Tell me only one thing. Is Captain Treherne still to marry our
      Lisa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so. There was a difficulty, but Mr. Johnston said he would
      'pass it over.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor papa,&rdquo; was all she replied. &ldquo;Poor papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my exceeding regret at what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never mind, you could not help it; I understand exactly how it was.
      But the storm will blow over; papa is rather peculiar. Don't tell Captain
      Treherne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood meditative a good while, and then said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are right about Mr. Treherne, I begin to like him myself a
      little, that is&mdash;No, I will not make pretences. I did not like him at
      all until lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her I knew that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Did I shew it? Do I shew what I feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerably,&rdquo; said I, smiling. &ldquo;But you do like him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another pause of consideration and then a second decisive &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;because he is good-natured, and sincere.
      Besides, he suits Lisabel, and people are so different, that it would be
      ridiculous to expect to choose one's sister's husband after the pattern of
      one's own. The two would probably not agree in any single particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said I, amused at her frankness. &ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for instance, Lisa likes talking, and I silence, or being talked
      to, and even that in moderation. Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We listened a minute to Treherne's hearty laugh and incessant
      chitter-chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my sister enjoys that, she says it amuses her; I am sure it would
      drive me crazy in a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could sympathise a little in this sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; with sudden seriousness, &ldquo;I beg you to understand, Doctor Urquhart,
      that I am not speaking against Captain Treherne. As I told you, I like
      him; I am quite satisfied with him, as a brother-in-law. Only, he is not
      exactly the sort of person one would choose to spend a week with in the
      Eddystone Lighthouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked if that was her test for all her friends? since so few could stand
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly not. When one comes to reflect, there are very few whose company
      one can tolerate so well as one's own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is itself not always agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but the less evil of the two. I don't believe there is a creature
      living whose society I could endure, without intermission, for a month, a
      week, or even two days. No. Emphatically no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She must then, though a member of a family, live a good deal alone&mdash;a
      fact I had already begun to suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, as I try to make Lisa feel&mdash;being the elder, I have a
      right to preach, you know&mdash;what an awful thing marriage must be, even
      viewed as mere companionship. Putting aside love, honour, obedience, and
      all that sort of thing, to undertake the burthen of any one person's
      constant presence and conversation for the term of one's natural life! the
      idea is frightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, if you do put aside love, honour, and all that sort of thing.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, as if she thought I was laughing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I talking very foolishly? I am afraid I do so sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it was pleasant to hear her talk.&rdquo; Which unlucky
      remark of mine had the effect of wholly silencing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, silent, it was something to watch her moving about the drawing-room,
      or sitting still over her work. I like to see a woman sewing; it gives her
      an air of peaceful homelikeness, the nearest approach to which, in us men,
      who are either always sullenly busy or lazily idle, is the ungainly lounge
      with our feet on the fender. Mr. Johnston must be happy in his daughters,
      particularly in this one. He can scarcely have regretted that he has had
      no sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems natural, seeing how much too well acquainted we are with our sex,
      its weaknesses and wickednesses, that most men long for, and make much of
      daughters. Certainly, to have in one's old age a bright girlish face to
      look at, a lively original girlish tongue to freshen one's mind with new
      ideas, must be a pleasant thing. Whatever may have been the sorrows of his
      past life, Mr. Johnston is a fortunate man now.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to Treherne, I had the satisfaction of perceiving that, as
      Miss Theodora had prophesied, the old man's anger had blown over. His
      manner indicated not merely forgiveness, but a degree of kindly interest
      in that lighthearted youth, who was brimming over with fun and
      contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an opportunity of satisfying myself on this point, in another
      quarter, while waiting in the hall for Treherne's protracted adieu in the
      dining-room; when Miss Theodora, passing me, stopped, to interchange a
      word with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you tell your friend what occurred to-night?&mdash;with papa, I
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied, I was not sure&mdash;but perhaps I should. It might act as a
      warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he needs a warning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. I believe Treherne is as likely to turn out a good man,
      especially with a good wife to help him, as any young fellow of my
      acquaintance; and I sincerely hope that you, as well as your father, will
      think no worse of him, for anything that is past. An old man has had time
      to forget, and a girl is never likely to understand, the exceeding
      temptations which every young man has to fight through,&mdash;more
      especially a young, man of fortune, and in the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;that is too true. Papa must have felt it. Papa
      wished this to be kept secret between himself and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then keep it. Do not tell Mr. Treherne. And have no fear that I shall be
      too hard upon him. It would be sad indeed, for all of us, who do wrong
      every day, if every error of youth were to be regarded as unpardonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      God bless her good heart, and the kindly hand she held out to me; which
      for the second time I dared to take in mine. Ay, even in <i>mine</i>.

      CHAPTER VIII. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> do not feel
      inclined for sleep, and there is a large round moon looking in at my
      window. My foolish old moon, what a time it is since you and I had a quiet
      serious look at one another. What things you used to say to me, and what
      confidences I used to make in you&mdash;at this very window, leaning my
      elbow in this very spot. That was when I was a child, and fond of Colin&mdash;&ldquo;Colin,
      my dear.&rdquo; How ridiculous it seems now, and what a laugh it would raise
      against me if anybody had known it. Yet what an innocent, simple, devoted
      child-love it was! I hardly think any after-love, supposing I should ever
      feel one, will be, in its way, more tender, or more true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moon, have you forgotten me? Am I becoming a middle-aged person; and is a
      new and younger generation growing up to have confidences with you as I
      used to have? Or is it I who have forsaken you? Most likely. You have done
      me a deal of harm&mdash;and good, too&mdash;in my time. Yet you seem
      friendly and mild to-night. I will forgive you, my poor old moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been a pleasant day. My head aches, a little, with the unusual
      excitement&mdash;query, of pleasure?&mdash;Is pleasantness so very rare,
      then?&mdash;No: I am weary with the exertion of having to make myself
      agreeable: for Penelope is full of housekeeping cares, and a few sad
      thoughts, too, may be, concerning the wedding; so that she takes little
      trouble to entertain visitors. And Lisabel is &ldquo;in love,&rdquo; you know, moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would not think it, though, except from the licence she takes to be
      lazy when Augustus is here, and up to the eyes in business when he is
      away. I never thought a wedding was such a &ldquo;piece of work,&rdquo; as the old
      women say; such a time of incessant bustle, worry, and confusion. I only
      saw the &ldquo;love&rdquo; side of it, Lisabel avers, and laughs at me when I wonder
      at her for wearing herself out from morning till night in consultation
      over her trousseau, and how we shall possibly manage to accommodate the
      eight-and-forty particular friends who must be asked to the breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, they are only the bride's friends. Sir William and Lady Augusta
      Treherne cannot come, and Augustus does not care a straw for asking
      anybody. He says he only wants his Lisa. His Lisa unfortunately requires a
      few trifles more to constitute her bridal happiness; a wreath, a veil, a
      breakfast, and six bridesmaids in Indian muslin. Rather cold, for autumn,
      but which she says she cannot give up on any account, since a wedding day
      comes but once, and she has been looking forward to her's ever since she
      was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wedding-day! Probably there are few of us who have not speculated on it
      a little, as the day which, of all others, is the most decisive in a
      woman's life. I am not ashamed to confess having occasionally thought of
      mine. A foolish dream that comes and goes with one's teens; imagined
      paradise of utterly impossible joy, to be shared with some paragon of
      equally impossible perfection&mdash;I could sit and laugh at it now, if
      the laughter were not bitterer than tears..
    </p>
    <p>
      There, after writing this, I went and pulled down my hair, and tied it
      under my chin to prevent cold&mdash;oh! most prudent five-and-twenty&mdash;leant
      my elbow on the window-sill, in the old attitude of fifteen, staring up at
      the moon and out across the firwoods for a long time. Returning, I have
      re-lit my candle, and taken once more to my desk, and I say again, O
      inquisitive moon, that this has been a pleasant day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of our quiet Rockmount Sundays, which Doctor Urquhart says he
      enjoys so much. Poor Lisabel's last Sunday but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She will be married to-morrow week. We had our indispensable lover to
      dinner, and Doctor Urquhart also. Papa told me to ask him as we were
      coming out of the church. In spite of the distance, he often attends our
      church now&mdash;at which papa seems gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      I delivered the message, which was not received with as much warmth as I
      thought it ought to have been, considering that it came from an elderly
      gentleman, who does not often pay a younger man than himself the
      compliment of liking his society. I was turning away, saying I concluded
      he had some better engagement, when Doctor Urquhart replied quickly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. That were impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come then? Pray don't, if you dislike it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I was vexed at a certain hesitation and uneasiness in his manner,
      which implied this; when I had been so glad to bring him the invitation
      and had taken the trouble to cross half the church-yard after him, in
      order to deliver it; which I certainly would not have done for a person
      whom everybody liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B. This may be one of the involuntary reasons for my liking Doctor
      Urquhart; that papa and I myself are the only two persons of our family
      who unite in that opinion. Lisabel makes fun of him; Penelope is scarcely
      civil to him; but that is because Francis, coming down last week for a
      day, took a violent aversion to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the girls laughing within a stone's throw of where we stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray please yourself, Doctor Urquhart; come, or not come; but I can't
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with an amused air;&mdash;yes, I certainly have the honour
      of amusing him, as a child or a kitten would&mdash;then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be happy to join us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was ashamed of myself for being thus pettish with a person so much older
      and wiser than I, and who ought to be excused so heartily for any
      peculiarities he has; yet he vexed me. He does vex me very much,
      sometimes. I cannot understand why; it is quite a new feeling to be so
      irritated with anybody. Either it is his manner, whieh is rather variable,
      sometimes cheerful and friendly, and then again restless and cold; or an
      uncomfortable sensation of being under control, which I never yet had,
      even towards my own father. Once, when I was contesting something with
      him, Augustus noticed it, and said, laughing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Doctor makes everybody do what he likes: you'd better give in at
      once. I always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I cannot, and I will not.
    </p>
    <p>
      To feel vexed with a person, to know they have the power of vexing you&mdash;that
      a chance word or look can touch you to the quick, make you feel all over
      in a state of irritation, as if all the world went wrong, and you were
      ready to do anything cross, or sullen, or childishly naughty&mdash;until
      another chance word or look happens to set you right again&mdash;this is
      an extremely uncomfortable state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must guard against it. I must not allow my temper to get way. Sensitive
      it is, I am aware, quick to feel sore, and to take offence; but I am not a
      thoroughly ill-tempered woman. Doctor Urquhart does not think so: he told
      me he did not. One day, when I had been very cross with him, he said &ldquo;I
      had done him no harm; that I often did him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Me&mdash;to do good to Doctor Urquhart! What an extraordinary thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to do people good&mdash;to do it my own self, too&mdash;a mean
      pleasure, perhaps, yet it is a pleasure, and I was pleased by this saying
      of Doctor Urquhart's. If I could but believe it! I do believe it
      sometimes. I know that I can make him smile, let him be ever so grave;
      that something in me and my ways interests and amuses him in an
      inglorious, kittenish fashion, as I said; yet, still, I draw him out of
      himself, I make him merry, I bring light into his face till one could
      hardly believe it was the same face that I first saw at 'the Cedars; and
      it is pleasant to me to think that, by some odd sympathy or other, I am
      pleasant to him, as I am to few&mdash;alas! to very few.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know when people dislike me: know it keenly, painfully; I know, too,
      with a sort of stolid patience, when they are simply indifferent to me.
      Doubtless, in both cases, they have every reason; I blame nobody, not even
      myself, I only state a fact. But with such people I can no more be my
      natural self, than I can run about, bare-footed and bare-headed, in our
      north winds or moorland snows. But if a little sunshine comes, my heart
      warms to it, basks in it, dances under it, like the silliest young lamb
      that ever frisked in a cowslip-meadow, rejoicing in the May.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not, and never pretend to be, a humble person. I feel there is that
      in me which is worth something, but a return for which I have never yet
      received. Give me its fair equivalent, its full and honest price, and oh,
      if I could expend it every mite, how boundlessly rich I should grow!
    </p>
    <p>
      This last sentence means nothing; nor do I quite understand it myself.
      Writing a journal is a safety-valve for much folly; yet I am by no means
      sure that I ought to have written the last page.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, no more of this; let me tell the story of my day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking from church, Doctor Urquhart told me that Augustus had asked him
      to be best-man at the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, I knew it, and wished he would consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the abrupt question surprised me, I answered, of course, the truth.
      That if the best-man were not himself, it would be one of the camp
      officers, and I hated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soldiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him, it was not kind to be always throwing in my teeth that
      unfortunate speech; that he ought not to teaze me so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I teaze you? I was not aware of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not; and I am a great simpleton for allowing myself to be
      teazed with such trifles. But Doctor Urquhart cannot expect me to be as
      wise as himself; he is a great deal older than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; he continued, in that kind tone, which always makes me
      feel something like a little pet donkey I once had, which, if I called it
      across the field, would come and lay its head on my hand,&mdash;not that,
      donkey as I am, I incline to trouble Doctor Urquhart in that way.&mdash;&ldquo;Tell
      me what it is you do hate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to have to entertain strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not consider me a stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I may say that; for short as our acquaintance dates, I have seen more of
      Doctor Urquhart, and seem to know him better than any man in the whole
      course of my life. He did not refuse the title I gave him, and I think he
      was gratified, though he said only:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, and I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently I recurred to the subject of discussion, and wished him to
      promise what Augustus, and Lisabel, and we all desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, then said, decisively:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. I know we can always depend upon Doctor Urquhart's
      promises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was my gladness over-bold? Would he misconstrue it? No&mdash;he is too
      clear-sighted, too humble-minded, too wise. With him, I have always the
      feeling that I need take no trouble over what I do or say, except that it
      should be true and sincere. Whatever it is, he will judge it fairly. And
      if he did not, why should I care?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I should care. I like him&mdash;I like him very much. It would be a
      comfort to me to have him for a friend&mdash;one of my very own. In some
      degree, he treats me as such; today, for instance, he told me more about
      himself than he ever did to any one of us. It came out accidentally. I
      cannot endure a man who, at first acquaintance, indulges you with his
      autobiography in full. Such an one must be either a puppy or an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Ah, there I am again, at my harsh judgments, which Doctor Urquhart
      has so often tacitly reproved. This good man, who has seen more of the
      world and its wickedness than I am ever likely to see, is yet the most
      charitable man I ever knew. To return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we reached Rockmount, the sky had clouded over, and in an hour it
      was a thoroughly wet afternoon. Penelope went upstairs to write her Sunday
      letter, and Augustus and Lisabel gave broad hints that they wished the
      drawing-room all to themselves. Perforce, Doctor Urquhart and I had to
      entertain ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took him into the greenhouse, where he lectured to me on the orchidacea
      and vegetation of the tropics generally,&mdash;to his own content,
      doubtless, and partially to mine. I like to hear his talking, so wise, yet
      so simple; a freshness almost boyish seems to linger in his nature still,
      and he has the thoroughly boyish peculiarity of taking pleasure in little
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent half an hour in reviving a big brown bee which had grown torpid
      with cold, and there was in his eyes a kindness, as over a human creature,
      when he gave into my charge his &ldquo;little patient,&rdquo; whom I promised to
      befriend. (There he is, poor old fellow, fast asleep on a flower-pot, till
      the first bright morning I can turn him out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, though, he will soon get into trouble again, and not find so
      kind a friend,&rdquo; said I, to Doctor Urquhart. &ldquo;He will intoxicate himself in
      the nearest flower-cup, and seek repentance and restoration too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said the Doctor, sadly and gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I was sorry for having made a jest upon his favourite doctrine of
      repentance and restoration of sinners, which he seemed always both to
      preach and to practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? Perhaps. Do you not think it's very much, needed in this world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, I had not lived long enough in the world to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot how young you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had once, in his direct way, asked my age, and I had told him, much
      disposed likewise to return the question, but was afraid. Sometimes I feel
      quite at home with him, as if I could say anything to him, and then again
      he makes me, not actually afraid&mdash;thank goodness, I never was afraid
      of any man yet, and hope I never shall be&mdash;but shy and quiet. I
      suppose it is because he is so very good; because in his presence my
      little follies and wickednesses hide their heads. I cease perplexing
      myself about them, or about myself at all, and only think&mdash;not of him
      so much as of something higher and better than either him or me. Surely
      this cannot be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bee question settled, we sat down, silent, listening to the rain
      pattering on the glass roof of the greenhouse. It was rather a dreary day.
      I began thinking of Lisabel's leaving more than was good for me; and, with
      that penetrative kindness which I have often noticed in him, Doctor
      Urquhart turned my sad thoughts away, by various information about
      Treherne Court, and the new relations of our Lisa&mdash;not many. I said,
      &ldquo;happily, she would have neither brother or sister-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily! You cannot be in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I half wished I had not been, and yet I could not but speak my mind&mdash;that
      brothers and sisters, in law or in blood, were often anything but a
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must emphatically differ from you there. I think it is, with few
      exceptional cases, the greatest misfortune to be an only child. Few are so
      naturally good, or reared under such favourable circumstances, that such a
      position does not do them harm. A lonely childhood and youth may make a
      great man, a good man, but it rarely makes a happy man. Better all the
      tussles and troubles of family life, where the angles of character are
      rubbed off, and its inclinations to morbidness, sensitiveness, and egotism
      knocked down. I think it is a great wonder to see Treherne such a good
      fellow as he is, considering he has been an only child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as if you knew what that was yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we were orphans, but I had one brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time Doctor Urquhart had reverted to any of his
      relatives, or to his early life. My curiosity was strong. I risked a
      question: was this brother older or younger than he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dallas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dallas Urquhart&mdash;what a nice name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is common in the family. There was a Dallas Urquhart, younger brother
      to a Sir John Urquhart, who, in the religious troubles, seceded to
      Episcopacy. He was in love with a minister's sister&mdash;a Presbyterian.
      She died broken-hearted, and in despair at her reproaches, Dallas threw
      himself down a precipice, where his whitened bones were not found till
      many years after. Is not that a romantic history?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said romantic and painful histories were common enough; there had been
      some, even in our matter-of-fact family. But he was not so inquisitive as
      I; nor should I have told him further; we never speak on this subject if
      we can help it. Even the Grantons&mdash;our intimate friends ever since we
      came to live at Rockmount&mdash;have never been made acquainted with it.
      And Penelope said there was no need to tell Augustus, as it could not
      affect him, or any person now living, and, for the sake of the family, the
      sad story was better forgotten. I think so, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh, I could not help observing to Doctor Urquhart, that it must
      be a very happy thing to have a brother&mdash;a good brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Mine was the best that any one ever had. He was a minister of the
      Kirk&mdash;that is, he would have been, but he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Scotland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;at Pau, in the Pyrenees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed a remembrance so acutely painful, that shortly afterwards I
      tried to change the subject, by asking a question or two about himself,&mdash;and
      especially what I had long wanted to find out&mdash;how he came by that
      eccentric Christian-name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it eccentric?&mdash;I really never knew or thought after whom I was
      called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suggested, Max Piccolomini.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he, pray? My improfessional reading has been small. I am ashamed
      to say I never heard of Max Piccolomini.&rdquo; Amused by this <i>naive</i>
      confession of ignorance, I offered jestingly to give him a course of
      polite literature, and begin with that grandest of German dramas,
      Schiller's Wallenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in German, if you please; I don't know a dozen words of the
      language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Doctor Urquhart, I must be a great deal cleverer than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had said this out of utter incredulity at the ludicrous idea; but, to my
      surprise, he took it seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. I know I am a coarse, uneducated person; the life of an
      army-surgeon allows few opportunities of refinement, and, like many
      another boy, I threw away my chances when I had them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;College, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you go to college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At St. Andrews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interrogative mood being on me, I thought I would venture a question
      which had been often on my mind to ask&mdash;namely, what made him choose
      to be a doctor, which always seemed to me the most painful and arduous of
      professions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so slow in answering, that I began to fear it was one of my too
      blunt queries, and apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, if you desire it. My motive was not unlike one you once
      suggested&mdash;to save life instead of destroying it; also, because I
      wished to have my own life always in my hand. I cannot justly consider it
      mine. It is <i>owed.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To heaven, I conclude he meant, by the solemnity of his manner. Yet, are
      not all lives owed? And, if so, my early dream of perfect bliss, namely,
      for two people to spend their lives together in a sort of domestic
      Pitcairn's Island, cradled in a spiritual Pacific Ocean, with nothing to
      do but to love one another&mdash;must be a delusion, or worse. I am
      beginning to be glad I never found it. We are not the birds and
      butterflies, but the labourers of the earthly vineyard. To discover one's
      right work and do it, must be the grand secret of life.&mdash;With or
      without love, I wonder? With it&mdash;I should imagine. But Doctor
      Urquhart in his plan of existence, never seems to think of such an
      insignificant necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet let me not speak lightly. I like him&mdash;I honor him. Had I been his
      dead brother, or a sister which he never had, I would have helped, rather
      than have hindered him in his self-sacrificing career. I would have
      scorned to put in my poor claim over him or his existence. It would have
      seemed like taking for daily uses the gold of the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here pondering over all I have heard of him and seen in him: the
      self-denial, the heroism, the religious purity of his daily life&mdash;which
      has roused in even the light heart of Augustus Treherne an attachment
      approaching to positive devotion, that all the jesting of Lisabel is
      powerless to shake, I call to mind one incident of this day, which
      startled, shocked me: concerning which even now I can scarcely credit the
      evidence of my own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had all gathered round the fire waiting papa's return from the second
      service, Penelope, Lisabel, Augustus, Doctor Urquhart, I. The rain had
      cleared off, and there was only a soft drip, drip, on the glass of the
      greenhouse outside. We were very peaceful and comfortable: it felt almost
      like a family circle&mdash;which, indeed it was, with one exception. The
      new member of our family seemed to make himself considerably at his ease&mdash;sat
      beside his Lisa, and held her hand under cover of her apron&mdash;at which
      I thought I saw Doctor Urquhart smile. Why should he? The caress was quite
      natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope was less restless than usual: owing may be to her long letter and
      the prospect of seeing Francis in a week: he comes to the marriage, of
      course. Poor fellow, what a pity we cannot have two weddings instead of
      one!&mdash;it is rather hard for him to be only a wedding guest and
      Penelope only a bridesmaid. But I am ceasing to laugh at even Francis and
      Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I myself, in my own little low chair in its right angle on the hearth-rug,
      felt perfectly happy. Is it the contrast between it and the life of
      solitude of which I have only lately had any knowledge that makes my own
      home life so much sweeter than it used to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen began talking together about the difference between this
      quiet scene and that of November last year: when, Sebastopol taken, the
      army was making up its mind to winter in idleness, as merrily as it could.
      And then Doctor Urquhart reverted to the former winter, the terrible time&mdash;until
      its miseries reached and touched the English heart at home. And yet, as
      Doctor Urquhart said, such misery seems often to evoke the noblest half of
      man's nature. Many an anecdote, proving this, he told about &ldquo;his poor
      fellows,&rdquo; as he called them; tales of heroism, patient endurance,
      unselfishness and generosity,&mdash;such as, in the mysterious agency of
      providence, are always developed by that great purifier as well as
      avenger, war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening, my cheek burnt to think I had ever said I hated soldiers. It is
      a solemn question, too momentous for human wisdom to decide upon, and,
      probably, never meant to be decided in this world&mdash;the justice of
      carnage, the necessity of war. But thus far I am convinced&mdash;and
      intend, the first opportunity, to express my thanks to Doctor Urquhart for
      having taught me the lesson&mdash;that to set one's self in fierce
      aversion against any class as a class, is both foolish and wicked. We
      should &ldquo;hate&rdquo; nobody. The Christian warfare is never against sinners, but
      against sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the statistics of mortality in the army, Doctor Urquhart
      surprised us by stating how small a percentage&mdash;bless me, I am
      beginning to talk like a blue-book&mdash;results from death in battle and
      from wounds. And strange as it may appear, the mortality in a? campaign,
      with all its fatal chances, is less than in barracks at home. He has long
      suspected this, from the accounts of the men, and having lately, from
      clear data, ascertained its accuracy, intends urging it at the Horse
      Guards, or failing there, in the public press,&mdash;that the causes may
      be inquired into and remedied. It will be at some personal risk:
      Government never likes being meddled with; but he seems the sort of man
      who, having once got an idea into his head, would pursue it to the death&mdash;and
      very right too. If I had been a man, I would have done exactly the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while, I have never told&mdash;that thing. It came out, as well
      as I can remember, thus:&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart was saying that the average mortality of soldiers in
      barracks was higher than that of any corresponding class of workingmen. He
      attributes this to want of space? cleanliness, fresh air, and good food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, to another cause, which you always find flourishing under such
      circumstances&mdash;drink. It is in a barracks just as in the courts and
      alleys of a large city&mdash;wherever you find people huddled together in
      foul air, ill smells, and general wretchedness&mdash;they drink. They
      cannot help it, it seems a natural necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, we have the Doctor on his hobby. Gee-up, Doctor!&rdquo; cried Augustus.
      I wonder his friend stands his nonsense so good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it is true, though, Treherne,&rdquo; and he went on speaking to me.
      &ldquo;In the Crimea, the great curse of our army was drink. Drink killed more
      of us than the Russians did. You should have seen what I have seen&mdash;the
      officer maddening himself with champagne at the mess-table&mdash;the
      private stealing out to a rum-store to booze secretly over his grog. The
      thing was obliged to be winked at, it was so common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In hospital, too,&rdquo; observed Captain Treherne gradually listening. &ldquo;Don't
      you remember telling me there was not a week passed that you had not cases
      of death solely from, drinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, even then, I could not stop it, nor keep the liquor outside the
      wards. I have come in and found drunken orderlies carousing with drunken
      patients: nay, more than once I have taken the brandy-bottle from under a
      dead man's pillow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I remember,&rdquo; said Augustus, looking grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel, who never likes his attention diverted from her charming self,
      cried saucily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very fine talking, Doctor,&mdash;but you shall not make me a
      teetotaller, nor Augustus neither, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the slightest intention of the kind, I assure you: nor does
      there seem any necessity. Though, for those who have not the power to
      resist intoxication, it is much safer never to touch stimulants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you never touch them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not done so for many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are afraid? Well, I dare say you were no better once than
      your neighbours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisabel!&rdquo; I whispered, for I saw Doctor Urquhart wince under her rude
      words: but there is no stopping that girl's tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now confess, Doctor, just for fun. Papa is not here, and we'll tell no
      tales out of school&mdash;were you ever in your life, to use your own ugly
      word, <i>drunk?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Writing this, I can hardly believe he said it, and yet he did, in a quiet,
      low voice, as if the confession were forced from him as a sort of
      voluntary expiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart <i>drunk!</i> What a frightful idea! Under what
      circumstances could it possibly have happened? One thing I would stake my
      life upon,&mdash;it never happened but that once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been thinking, how horrible it must be to see anybody one cared for
      drunk: the honest eyes dull and meaningless; the wise lips jabbering
      foolishness; the whole face and figure, instead of being what one likes to
      look at, takes pleasure to see in the same room, even,&mdash;growing ugly,
      irrational, disgusting&mdash;more like a beast than a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet some women have to bear it, have to speak kindly to their husbands,
      hide their brutishness, and keep them from making worse fools of
      themselves than they can help. I have seen it done, not merely by
      working-men's wives, but lady-wives in drawing-rooms. I think, if I were
      married, and I saw my husband the least overcome by wine, not &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; may
      be, but just excited, silly, otherwise than his natural self, it would
      nearly drive me wild. Less on my own account than his. To see him sink&mdash;not
      for a great crime, but a contemptible, cowardly bit of sensualism&mdash;from
      the height where my love had placed him; to have to take care of him, to
      pity him&mdash;ay, and I might pity him, but I think the full glory and
      passion of my love would die out, then and there, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me not think of this, but go on relating what occurred to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart's abrupt confession, which seemed to surprise Augustus as
      much as anybody, threw an awkwardness over us all; we slipped out of the
      subject, and plunged into the never-ending theme&mdash;the wedding and its
      arrangements. Here I found out that Doctor Urquhart had, at first,
      refused, point-blank, his friend's request that he would be best-man, but,
      on my entreating him this morning, had changed his mind. I was glad, and
      expressed my gladness warmly. I would not like Doctor Urquhart to suppose
      we thought the worse of him for what he had confessed, or rather been
      forced into confessing. It was very wrong of Lisabel. But she really
      seemed sorry, and paid him special attention in consultations about what
      she thinks the important affairs of Monday week. I was almost cross at the
      exemplary patience with which he examined the orange-tree, and pronounced
      that the buds would open in time, he thought; that if not, he would try,
      as in duty bound, to procure some. He also heroically consented to his
      other duty, of returning thanks for &ldquo;the bridesmaids,&rdquo; for we are to have
      healths drunk, speeches made, and all the rest of it. Mercy on us! how
      will papa ever stand it!
    </p>
    <p>
      These family events have always their painful side. I am sure papa will
      feel it. I only trust that no chance observations will strike home, and
      hurt him. This fear haunted me so much, that I took an opportunity of
      suggesting to Dr. Urquhart that all the speeches had better be as short as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine shall be, I promise. Were you afraid of it?&rdquo; asked he, smiling; it
      was just before the horses were brought up, and we were all standing but
      in the moonlight&mdash;for shame, moon, leading us to catch cold just
      before our wedding, and very thoughtless of the Doctor to allow it, too. I
      could see by his smile that he was now quite himself again,&mdash;which
      was a relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense; I shall expect you to make the grandest speech that ever
      was heard. But, seriously, these sort of speeches are always trying, and
      will be so, especially to papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. We must take care: you are a thoughtful little lady.&rdquo;&mdash;He
      sometimes has called me &ldquo;Little lady,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Miss Theodora.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      your father will feel acutely this first break in the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I did not mean that exactly, as it was not the case. And, for the
      first time, it struck me as sad, that one whom I never knew, whom I
      scarcely ever think of, should be lost from among us, so lost as not to be
      even named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart asked me why I looked so grave? At first I said I had
      rather not tell him, and then I felt as if at that moment, standing
      quietly talking in the lovely night, after such a happy day, it were a
      comfort, almost a necessity, to tell him anything, everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of someone belonging to me whom nobody knows of, whom we
      never speak about. Hush, don't let them hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it? But I beg your pardon, do not tell me unless you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From his tone,&mdash;he thought, I know he thought&mdash;&mdash; Oh, what
      a ridiculous, impossible thing! Then I was determined to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was one&mdash;who was Papa's favourite among us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not time to say any more, for they were just starting, nor am I
      satisfied that I was right in saying so much. But the confidence is safe
      with him, and he will never refer to it; he will feel, as we do, that a
      subject so painful is best avoided, even among ourselves&mdash;on the
      whole I am glad he knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming indoors, the girls made me very angry by their jests, but the anger
      has somehow evaporated now. What does it matter? As I told Lisabel,
      friends do not grow on every hedge, though lovers may, and when one finds
      a good man one ought to value him, nor be ashamed of it either.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, my sweet moon, setting so quickly behind that belt of firs, I <i>will</i>
      like him if I choose, as I like everything true and noble wherever I find
      it in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moon, it is a good world, a happy world, and grows happier the longer one
      lives in it. So I will just watch your silver ladyship&mdash;a nice
      &ldquo;little lady&rdquo; you are too, slipping away from it with that satisfied
      farewell smile, and then&mdash;I shall go to bed.

      Last Sunday week I made a discovery&mdash;in truth, two discoveries&mdash;after
      which I lost myself, as it were, for many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be advisable not to see any more of that family. Not that I have
      any proof that they are <i>the</i> family&mdash;the name itself, Johnson,
      and their acknowledged plebeian origin, is sufficient evidence to the
      contrary. But, if they had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere supposition, coming, instinctively, that Sunday night, before
      reason argued it down&mdash;was enough to cause me twelve such hours as
      would be purchased dearly with twelve years of life&mdash;even a life full
      of such happiness as, I then learnt, is possible for a man. But not for
      me.&mdash;Never for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      This phase of the subject is, however, so exclusively my own, that even
      here I will pass it over. It will be conquered by-and-by&mdash;being
      discovered in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the marriage&mdash;having promised. She said, Doctor Urquhart
      never breaks his promises. No. There is one promise&mdash;nay, vow&mdash;kept
      unflinchingly for twenty years, could it be broken now? It never could.
      Before it is too late&mdash;I will take steps to teach myself that it
      never shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only joined the marriage-party during the ceremony. They excused me the
      breakfast, speeches, &amp;c.&mdash;Treherne knew I was not well. Also, she
      said I looked &ldquo;over-worked,&rdquo;&mdash;and there was a kind of softness in her
      eye, the pity that all women have, and so readily show.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked the very picture of a white fairy, or a wood-nymph&mdash;or an
      angel, sliding down on a sunshiny cloud to a man asleep.&mdash;He wakes
      and it is all gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the register was being signed&mdash;and they wished me to be one of
      the attesting witnesses&mdash;an idea came into my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family must have settled at Rockmount for many years. Probably, the
      grandfather, the farmer who wrote himself, plebeianly, &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; was
      buried here. Or&mdash;if he were dead, but whether it was so or not, I had
      no clue&mdash;here probably, would be registered the interment of that
      brother to whom allusion had been made as &ldquo;papa's favourite,&rdquo; but in such
      a manner, and with such evident distress, that to make further inquiry
      about him was impossible. Besides, I must have no more private talk with
      her&mdash;with the one of the Misses Johnston whom I know best.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brother&mdash;I have calculated his possible age, compared with
      theirs. Even were he the eldest of them, he could not now be much above
      thirty&mdash;if alive. <i>That person</i> would now be at least fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, at once and for ever to root up any such morbid, unutterable
      fancies, I thought it would be as well to turn over the register-books,
      as, without suspicion, it was this day easy to do. On my way home I
      stopped at the church&mdash;and, helped by the half-stupid sexton and
      bell-ringer, went over the village records of, he declared, the last
      twenty years, and more. In none of them was once named the family of
      Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      No proof, therefore, of my cause of dread&mdash;not an atom, not a straw.
      All evidence hitherto going directly counter to a supposition&mdash;the
      horror of which would surpass all horrible coincidences that fate could
      work out for a man's punishment. Let me put it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other thing&mdash;God help me! I believe I shall also be able to put
      aside&mdash;being entirely my own affair&mdash;and I myself being the only
      sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Treherne is married and away, there will be no necessity to visit at
      Rockmount any more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hat a change a
      marriage makes&mdash;what a blank it leaves in a house! Ours has been very
      dull since poor Lisa went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not why I call her &ldquo;poor Lisa.&rdquo; She seems the gayest of the gay,
      and the happiest of the happy; two characters which, by the way, are not
      always identical. Her letters from Paris are full of enjoyment. Augustus
      takes her everywhere, and introduces her to everybody. She was the &ldquo;belle
      mariée&rdquo; of a ball at the British Embassy, and has been presented to my old
      aversion, though he is really turning out a creditable individual in some
      things; &ldquo;never too late to mend,&rdquo; even for a Louis Napoleon. Of course,
      Lisabel now thinks him &ldquo;the most charming man in the world,&rdquo; except
      Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange, that she should take delight in such dissipations. She, not three
      weeks married. How very little she must have of her husband's society.
      Now, I should think the pleasantest way of spending a honeymoon would be
      to get out of everybody's way, and have a little peace and quiet, rambling
      about at liberty, and looking at pretty places together. But tastes
      differ; that is not Lisabel's fancy, nor was her's the sort of marriage
      likely to make such a honeymoon desirable. She used to say she should get
      tired of the angel Gabriel if she had him all to herself for four mortal
      weeks. Possibly; I remember once making a similar remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      But surely that dread and weariness of two people, in being left to one
      another's sole society, must apply chiefly to cases of association for
      mere amusement or convenience; not to those who voluntarily bind their
      lives together, &ldquo;for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness
      and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part;&rdquo; how solemn
      the words are! They thrilled me all through, on the morning of Lisabel's
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never set down here anything about that day. I suppose it resembled
      most other wedding-days&mdash;came and went like a dream, and not a very
      happy dream either. There seemed a cloud over us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the reasons was, Francis did not come: at the last minute, he sent
      an apology; which was not behaving well, I thought. Nor did the excuse
      seem a valid one. But it might have been a painful day to him, and Francis
      is one of those sort of people&mdash;very pleasant, and not ill-meaning
      people either&mdash;who like to escape pain, if possible. Still, he might
      have considered that it was not likely to be the happiest of days to
      Penelope herself, nor made more so by his absence;&mdash;which she bore in
      perfect silence; and nobody, except Augustus, who observed, laughingly,
      that it was &ldquo;just like cousin Charteris,&rdquo; ventured any comment on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not join Mrs. Granton and our Lisa in their tirades against long
      engagements. I do not see why, when people are really fond of one another,
      and cannot possibly be married, they should not live contentedly betrothed
      for an indefinite time: it is certainly better than living wholly apart,
      forlorn and hopeless, neither having towards the other any open right, or
      claim, or duty. But then every betrothal should resemble marriage itself,
      in its perfect confidence, patience, and unexacting tenderness. Also, it
      ought never to be made so public, or allowed to be so cruelly talked over,
      as this engagement of Penelope's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Francis did not appear, and everybody left earlier than we had
      expected. On the marriage evening, we were quite alone; and the day after,
      Rockmount was its dull self again, except the want of poor Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still call her so&mdash;I cannot help it. We never discover the value of
      things till we have lost them. Out of every corner I miss our Lisa&mdash;her
      light laugh that used to seem heartless, yet was the merriest sound in the
      house; her tall, handsome figure sailing in and about the rooms; her
      imperturbable good-temper, which I often tried&mdash;her careless, untidy
      ways, that used for ever to aggravate Penelope&mdash;down to her very
      follies and flirtations, carried on to the last in spite of Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      My poor Lisa! The putting away of her music from the piano, her books from
      the shelf, and her clothes from the drawers, cost me as sharp an agony as
      I ever had in my life. I was not half good enough to her when I had her,&mdash;if
      I had her again, how different it should be. Ah, that is what we always
      say, as the great shadow Time keeps advancing and advancing, yet we always
      let it slip by, and we cannot make it go back for a single hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Granton and Colin came to tea to-night. Their company was a relief;
      our evenings are often very dull. We sit all three together, but no one
      has much sympathy with what the other is doing or thinking; as not seldom
      happens in families, we each live in a distinct world of our own, never
      intruded on, save when we collectively entertain visitors. Papa asked
      Doctor Urquhart to dinner twice, but received an apology both times, which
      rather offended him, and he says he shall not invite him again until he
      has called. He ought to call, for an old man likes attention, and is
      justified in exacting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, while Mrs. Granton gossipped with papa and Penelope, Colin
      talked to me. He bears Lisabel's marriage far better than I expected,
      probably because he has got something to do. He told me a long story about
      a row of labourers' cottages, which Doctor Urquhart advised him to build
      at the corner of the moor, each with its bit of land, convertible into a
      potato-field or a garden. There Colin busies himself from morning till
      night, superintending, planning, building, draining, &ldquo;working like a
      horse,&rdquo; he protests, &ldquo;and never enjoyed anything more in his life.&rdquo; He
      says, he has seen a great deal of Doctor Urquhart lately, and had great
      assistance from him in the matter of these cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then can he be so exceedingly occupied as not to have an hour or two for a
      visit? Shame on me for the suspicion! The idea that Doctor Urquhart would,
      even in a polite excuse, state a thing which was not true!
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin is much improved. He is beginning to suspect that Colin Granton,
      Esq., owner of a free estate, and twenty-seven years old, has got
      something to do besides lounge about, shoot rabbits, and play billiards.
      He opened up to my sympathy a long series of schemes about these cottages:
      how he meant to instigate industry, cleanliness, and, indeed, all the
      cardinal virtues, by means of cottagers' prizes for tidy houses, well-kept
      gardens, and the best brought-up and largest families. He will never be
      clever, poor Colin! but he may be a most useful character in the county,
      and he has the kindest heart in the world. By the way, he told me in his
      ultra-simple fashion, that somebody had informed him one of the Rockmount
      young ladies said so! I felt myself grow hot to the ears, which
      exceedingly astonished Colin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, a not unpleasant evening. But oh, moon!&mdash;whom I saw
      making cross-panes on the carpet, when I came in&mdash;it was not like the
      evenings a month ago, when Lisabel was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think women, as well as men, require something to do. I wish I had it;
      it would do me as much good as it has done Colin. I am beginning to fear I
      lead a wretchedly idle life: all young ladies at home do, it seems, except
      perhaps the eldest sister, if she chances to be such a woman as our
      Penelope. Why cannot I help Penelope? Mrs. Granton took it for granted
      that I do; that I shall be the greatest comfort and assistance to Miss
      Johnston, now Miss Lisabel is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not, the least in the world! which I would fain have explained, only
      mere friends can never understand the ins and outs of a family. If I
      offered to assist her in the house, how Penelope would stare! Or even in
      her schools and parish&mdash;but that I cannot do. Teaching is to me
      perfectly intolerable. The moment I have to face two dozen pairs of round
      eyes, every particle of sense takes flight, and I become the veriest of
      cowards, ready to sink through the floor. The same, too, in district
      visiting. What business have I, because I happen to be the clergyman's
      daughter, to go lifting the latch, and poking about poor people's houses,
      obliging them to drop me curtseys, and receive civilly my tracts and
      advice&mdash;which they neither read nor follow; and might be none the
      better for it if they did?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this may be only my sophistries for not doing what I so heartily
      dislike. Others do it&mdash;and successfully: take by storm the poor
      folks' hearts, and, what is better, their confidence; never enter without
      a welcome, and depart without a blessing; as, for instance, Dr. Urquhart.
      Mrs. Granton was telling about his doings among the poor families down
      with fever and ague, near the camp, at Moor-edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why cannot I do the same good? not so much, of course, but just a little?
      Why can not somebody show me how to do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I am not worthy. My quarter-century of-life has been of no more use to
      myself or any human creature than that fly's which my fire has stirred up
      to a little foolish buzzing in the window-curtain, before it drops and
      dies. I might drop down and die in the same manner, leaving no better
      memorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&mdash;I hear Penelope in her room fidgetting about her drawers, and
      scolding the housemaid&mdash;she is always taking juvenile incompetent
      housemaids out of her village school, teaching and lecturing them for a
      twelvemonth, and then grumbling because they leave her. Yet, this is doing
      good: sometimes, they come back and thank her for having made capital
      servants of them; and very seldom, indeed, does such a case happen, as
      pretty, silly Lydia Cartwright's, who went up to London and never came
      back any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear sister Penelope, who, except in company, hardly has a civil word
      for anybody&mdash;Francis excepted:&mdash;Penelope, who has managed the
      establishment ever since she was a girl of sixteen; has kept the house
      comfortable, and maintained the credit of the family to the world without,&mdash;truly,
      with all your little tempers, sneers, and crabbednesses, you are worth a
      dozen of your sister Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if Doctor Urquhart thinks so. He looked at her closely, more than
      once, when we were speaking about Francis. He and she would have many
      meeting points of interest, if they only knew it, and talked much
      together. She is not very sweet to him, but that would not matter; he only
      values people for what they are, and not for the manner in which they
      behave to himself. Perhaps, if they were better acquainted, Penelope might
      prove a better friend for him than the &ldquo;little lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little lady!&rdquo; that is just such a name as one would give to an idle,
      useless butterfly-creature, of no value but as an amusement, a plaything
      of leisure-hours; in time of business or care to be altogether set aside
      and forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does he think me that? If he does&mdash;why, let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine proof of how dull Rockmount is, and how little I have to write
      about when I go on scribbling such trivialities as these. If no better
      subjects can be found, I shall give up my journal. Meantime, I intend next
      week to begin a serious course of study, in history, Latin and German, for
      the latter, instead of desultory reading, I shall try written
      translations, probably from my favourite, Wallenstein.&mdash;To think that
      anybody should have been ignorant even of the name of Max Piccolomini! He
      always was my ideal of a hero,&mdash;faithful, trustful, brave, and
      infinitely loving; yet able to renounce love itself for the sake of
      conscience.&mdash;And then, once a-week I shall have a long letter to
      write to Lisabel&mdash;I who never had a regular correspondence in my
      life. It will be almost as good as Penelope's with Francis Char-teris.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, I hear Penelope dismiss her maiden, bolt the door, and settle for
      the night. When, for a wonder, she finds herself alone and quiet, with
      nothing to do, and nobody to lecture,&mdash;I wonder what Penelope thinks
      about? Is it Francis? Do people in their position always think about one
      another the last thing? Probably. When all the day's cares and pleasures
      are ended, and the rest of the world shut out, the heart would naturally
      turn to the only one in whom, next to Heaven, is its real rest, its best
      comfort, closer than either friend, or brother, or sister &mdash;less
      another person than half itself?
    </p>
    <p>
      No sentiment! Go to bed, Theodora.

      CHAPTER XI. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had almost given
      up writing here. Is it wise to begin again? Yet, to-day, in the silent
      hut, with the east wind howling outside almost as fiercely as it used to
      howl last winter over the steppes of the Caucasus, one must do something,
      if only to kill time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, I have little need for that resource; this barrack business
      engrosses every leisure hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander-in-chief has at length promised a commission of inquiry, if
      sufficient data can be supplied to him to warrant it. I have, therefore,
      been collecting evidence from every barrack in the United Kingdom,&mdash;and
      visiting personally all within a day or two days' leave from the camp. The
      most important were those of the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless here to recur to details of which my head has been full all
      the week; till a seventh day's rest and change of ideas becomes almost
      priceless. Unprofessional men cannot understand this; young Granton could
      not, when coming down from town with me last night, he was lamenting that
      he should not get at his cottage-building, which he keeps up in defiance
      of winter weather, till Monday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Granton indulged me with much conversation about some friends of his,
      which inclines me to believe that &ldquo;the kindest heart in the world&rdquo; has not
      suffered an incurable blow, and is already proceeding to seek consolation
      elsewhere. It may be so. The young are pleasant to the young: the happy
      delight in the happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to my poor fellows; my country bumpkins and starving mechanics,
      caught by the thirteen pence a-day, and after all the expensive drilling
      that is to make them proper food for powder, herded together like beasts
      in a stall, till, except under strong coercion, the beast nature is apt to
      get uppermost&mdash;and no wonder. I must not think of rest till I have
      left no stone unturned for the furtherance of this scheme concerning my
      poor fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, the older one grows, the more keenly one feels how little power
      one individual man has for good&mdash;whatever he may have for evil. At
      least, this is the suggestion of a morbid spirit, after aiming at
      everything and doing almost nothing&mdash;which seemed the brief catalogue
      of my week's labour, last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      People are so slow to join in any reformatory schemes. They will talk
      enough of the need for it,&mdash;but they will not act&mdash;it is too
      much trouble. Most men are engrossed in their own private concerns,
      business, amusements, or ambitions. It is incredible, the difficulty I had
      in hunting up some, who were the most active agents of good in the Crimea&mdash;and
      of these, how few could be convinced that there was anything needed to be
      done at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Horse Guards, where my face must be as familiar as that of the
      clock on the quadrangle to those gentlemanly young clerks&mdash;no
      attention was wanting, but that of furthering my business. However, the
      time was not altogether wasted, as in various talks with former
      companions, whom I there by chance waylaid, ideas were thrown out that may
      be brought to bear in different quarters. And, as always happens, from
      some of the very last quarters where anything was to be expected, the
      warmest interest and assistance came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise&mdash;and this forms the bright spot in a season not particularly
      pleasant&mdash;during my brief stay in London, the first for many years,
      more than one familiar face has come across me out of far back times, with
      a welcome and remembrance, the warmth and heartiness of which both
      surprised and cheered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those I met on Thursday, was an old colonel, under whom I went out
      on my first voyage as assistant-surgeon, twelve years ago. He stopped me
      in the Mall, addressing me by name; I had almost forgotten his, till his
      cordial greeting brought it to mind. Then we fell to upon many mutual
      questions and reminiscences.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he should have known me anywhere, though I was altered a good
      deal in some respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All for the better, though, my boy&mdash;beg pardon, Doctor&mdash;but you
      were such a slip of a lad, then. Thought we should have had to throw you
      overboard before the voyage was half over, but you cheated us all, you
      see,&mdash;and, 'pon my life, hard as you must have been at it since then,
      you look as if you had many years more of work in you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I hoped so,&mdash;which I do, for some things, and then, in
      answer to his friendly questions, I entered into the business which had
      brought me to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good colonel was brimful of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has a warm heart, plenty of money, thinks that money can do everything.
      I had the greatest difficulty in persuading him that his cheque-book would
      not avail me with the commander-in-chief, or the honourable British
      officers whom I hoped to stir up to some little sympathy with the men they
      commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can't I help you at all?&mdash;can't my son, either?&mdash;you
      remember Tommy, who used to dance the sailor's hornpipe on the deck. Such
      a dandy young fellow;&mdash;got him a place under Government&mdash;capital
      berth, easy hours, eleven till four, and regular work&mdash;the whole <i>Times</i>
      to read through daily. Ha! ha! you understand, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed too, for it was a pretty accurate description of what I had this
      week seen in Government offices; indeed, in public offices of all kinds,
      where the labour is so largely sub-divided as to be in the responsible
      hands of very few, and the work and the pay generally follow in an
      opposite ratio of progression. In the present instance, from what I
      remember of him, no doubt such a situation would exactly suit Master Tommy
      Turton.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father and I strolled up and down the shiny half-dried pavement till
      the street-lamps were lighted, and the club-windows began to brighten and
      glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll dine with me, of course&mdash;not at the United Service&mdash;it's
      my day with Tom at his club, the New Universal, capital club too. No
      apologies; we'll quarter ourselves upon Tommy, he will be delighted. He's
      extremely proud of his club; the young rogue costs me&mdash;it's
      impossible to say what Tom costs me per annum, over and above his pay. Yet
      he is a good lad, too&mdash;as lads go&mdash;holds up his head among all
      the young fellows of the club, and keeps the very best of company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So went on the worthy old father&mdash;with more, which I forget. I had
      been on my feet all day, and was what women call &ldquo;tired,&rdquo;&mdash;when they
      delight to wheel out arm-chairs and push warmed slippers under wet feet&mdash;at
      least, so I have seen done.
    </p>
    <p>
      London club-life was new to me; nor was I aware that in this England, this
      &ldquo;home,&rdquo;&mdash;words, which abroad we learn to think synonymous and invest
      with an inexpressible charm,&mdash;so large a proportion of the middle
      classes assume by choice the sort of life which, on foreign service, we
      put up with of necessity; the easy selfish life into which a male
      community is prone to fall. The time-honoured United Service, I was
      acquainted with; but the New Universal was quite a dazzle of brilliant
      plate, a palace of upholstery. Tom had not come in, but his father showed
      me over his domains with considerable pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; this is how we live&mdash;he at his club and I at mine. We have two
      tidy bedrooms, somewhere or other, hard by,&mdash;and that's all. A very
      jolly life, I assure you, if one hasn't the gout or the blues; we have
      kept to it ever since the poor mother died, and Henrietta married. I
      sometimes tell Tom he ought to settle; but he says it would be slow, and
      he can't afford it. Hollo! here's the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom&mdash;a &ldquo;boy&rdquo; six feet high, good-looking and well-dressed, after the
      exact pattern of a few dozen more, whom we had met strolling arm-in-arm
      down Pall-Mall&mdash;greeted me with great civility, and said he
      remembered me perfectly&mdash;though my unfortunately quick ears detected
      him asking his father, aside, &ldquo;where on earth he had picked up that old
      fogie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We dined well&mdash;and a good dinner is not a bad thing. As a man gets
      old, he may be allowed some cheer&mdash;in fact, he needs it. Whether, at
      twenty-four, he needs five courses and half-a-dozen kinds of wine is
      another question. But Master Tom was my host, so silence! Perhaps I am
      becoming, &ldquo;an old fogie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, the colonel opened out warmly upon my business, which his
      son evidently considered a bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He really did not understand the matter; it was not in his department of
      public business; the governor always thought they must know everything
      that was going on, when, in truth, they knew nothing at all. He should be
      most happy, but had not the least notion what it was in his power to do
      for Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart laboured to make the young gentleman understand that he
      really did not want him to do anything, to which Tom listened with that
      philosophical <i>laissez-faire</i>, kept just within the bounds of
      politeness, that we of an elder generation are prone to find fault with.
      At last, an idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, father, there's Charteris,&mdash;knows everything and everybody&mdash;would
      be just the man for you. There he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed eagerly to a gentleman, who, six tables off, lounged over
      his wine and newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning, as I stood talking in an anteroom, at the Horse Guards, this
      gentleman had caught my notice, leaning over one of the clerks, and
      enlivening their dullness by making a caricature. Now my phiz was quite at
      their service, but it seemed scarcely fair for any but that king of
      caricature, &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; to make free with the honest, weather-beaten features
      of the noble old veteran who was talking with me. So I just intervened&mdash;not
      involuntarily&mdash;between the caricaturist and my&mdash;shall I honour
      myself by calling him my friend? the good old warrior, might not deny it.
      For Mr. Char-teris, he apparently did not wish to own my acquaintance, nor
      had I any desire to resume his. We passed without recognition, as I would
      willingly have done now, had not Colonel Turton seized upon the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom's right. Charteris is the very man. Has enormous influence, and
      capital connections, though, between you and me, Doctor, calls himself as
      poor as a church-mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred a-year,&rdquo; said Tom, grimly. &ldquo;Wish I'd as much! Still, he's a
      nice fellow, and jolly good company. Here, waiter, take my compliments to
      Mr. Charteris, and will he do us the honour of joining us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Charteris came.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared surprised at sight of me, but we both went through the
      ceremony of introduction without mentioning that it was not for the first
      time. And during the whole conversation, which lasted until the
      dinner-sounds ceased, and the long, bright, splendid dining-room was all
      but deserted, we neither of us once adverted to the little parlour where,
      for a brief five minutes, Mr. Charteris and myself had met some weeks
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarcely noticed him then; now I did. He bore out Tom's encomium and
      the colonel's. He is a highly intelligent, agreeable person, apparently
      educated to the utmost point of classical refinement. The sort of man who
      would please most women, and who, being intimate in a family of sisters,
      would with them involuntarily become their standard of all that is
      admirable in our sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mr. Charteris was much really to be admired: a grace bordering on what
      in one sex we call sweetness, in the other effeminacy. Talent, too, not
      original or remarkable, but indicating an evenly-cultivated, elegant mind.
      Rather narrow, it might be&mdash;all about him was small, neat, regular;
      nothing in the slightest degree eccentric, or diverging from the ordinary,
      being apparently possible to him; a pleasure-loving temperament,
      disinclined for active energy in any direction&mdash;this completed my
      impression of Mr. Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he gave me no information,&mdash;indeed, he seemed like my young
      friend Tom to make a point of knowing as little and taking as slight
      interest as possible, in the state machinery of which he formed a part&mdash;he
      contributed very considerably to the enjoyment of the evening. It was he
      who suggested our adjournment to the theatre..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless Doctor Urquhart objects. But I dare say we can find a house where
      the performance trenches on none of the ten commandments, about which, I
      am aware, he is rather particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;'Thou shalt not steal,' from the French; and 'Thou shalt
      do no murder' on the Queen's English, are the only commandments
      indispensable on the stage. Come away, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a sad dog,&rdquo; said the father, shaking his fist at him, with a
      delighted grin, which reminded me of hornpipe-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sad dog knew where to find the best bones to pick, and by no means
      dry, either. Now, though I am not a book-man, I love my Shakspere well
      enough not to like him acted&mdash;his grand old flesh and blood digged up
      and served out to this modern taste as a painted, powdered, dressed-up
      skeleton. But this night I saw him &ldquo;in his habit as he lived,&rdquo; presented
      &ldquo;in very form and fashion of the time.&rdquo; There was a good deal of show,
      certainly, it being a pageant play; but you felt show was natural; that
      just in such a way the bells must have rung, and the people shouted, for
      the living Bolingbroke. The acting, too, was natural; and to me, a plain
      man, accustomed to hold women sacred, and to believe that a woman's arms
      should be kept solely for the man who loves her, I own it was a
      satisfaction when the stage <i>Queen</i> clung to the stage <i>King
      Richard</i>, in that pitiful parting, where,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Bad men, ye violate
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A twofold marriage&mdash;'twixt my crown and me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And then between me and my married wife,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      it was a satisfaction, I say, to know that it was her own husband the
      actress was kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This play, which Tom and the colonel voted &ldquo;slow,&rdquo; gave me two hours of
      the keenest, most utterly oblivious, enjoyment; a desideratum not easily
      attainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Charteris considered it fine in its way; but, after all, there was
      nothing like the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Charteris is opera-mad,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Every subscription-night, there
      he is, wedged in the crowd at the horrid little passage leading out of the
      Haymarket&mdash;among a knot of his cronies, who don't mind making martyrs
      of themselves for a bit of tootle-te-tooing, a kick-up, and a twirl. Well,
      I'm not fond of music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Mr. Charteris, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of looking at pretty women, too, eh, my dear fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here he diverged to a passing criticism on the pretty women in the
      boxes round us: who were not few. I observed them, also&mdash;for I notice
      women's faces more than I was wont&mdash;but none were satisfactory, even
      to the eye. They all seemed over-conscious of themselves and their looks,
      except one small creature, in curls, and a red mantle&mdash;about the age
      of the poor wounded Russ, who might have been my own little adopted girl
      by this time, if she had not died.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish, sometimes, she had not died. My life would have been less lonely,
      could I have adopted that child.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be more beauty&mdash;I have heard there is, in the upper class
      of Englishwomen than in any race of women on the globe. But a step lower
      in rank, less smoothly cosmopolitan, more provincially and honestly Saxon;
      reserved, yet frank; simple, yet gay, would be the Englishwoman of one's
      heart. The man who dare open his eyes, fearlessly, to the beauties of such
      an one&mdash;seek her in a virtuous middle-class home, ask her of her
      proud father and mother; then win her and take her, joyfully, to sit by
      his happy hearth, wife&mdash;matron&mdash;<i>mother</i>&mdash;&mdash; I
      forget how that sentence was to have ended; however, it is of little
      consequence. It was caused partly by some reflection on this club-life,
      and another darker side of it, of which I caught some glimpses when I was
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      We finished the evening at the theatre pleasantly. In the sort of
      atmosphere we were in, harmless enough, but glaring, unquiet, and
      unhome-like, I was scarcely surprised that Mr. Charteris did not once name
      the friends at whose house I first met him; indeed, he seemed to avoid the
      slightest approach to the subject. Only once, as we were pushing together,
      side by side, into the cool night air, he asked me, in a low hurried tone,
      if I had been to Rock-mount lately? He had heard I was present at the
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I made some remark about his absence being much regretted that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;-yes. Shall you be there soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was put with an anxiety, which my answer in the negative
      evidently relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then&mdash;I need send no message. I thought you were very intimate.
      A charming family&mdash;a very charming family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were wandering to some ladies of fashion who had recognised him&mdash;whom
      he put into their carriage with that polite assiduity which seems an
      instinct with him, and in the crowd we lost sight of Mr. Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice afterwards I saw him; once, driving in the park with two ladies in a
      coroneted carriage: and again walking in the dusk of the afternoon down
      Kensington-road. This time he started, gave me the slightest recognition
      possible, and walked on faster than ever. He need not have feared:&mdash;I
      had no wish or intention of resuming our acquaintance. The more I hear of
      him, the more increases my surprise&mdash;nay, even not unmixed with
      anxiety&mdash;at his position, in the family at Rockmount.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I was suddenly called out to a bad accident case, some miles across
      the country; whence I have only returned in time for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to do anything for the poor fellow; one of Granton's
      labourers, who knew me by sight. I could only wait till all was over, and
      the widow a little composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her urgent request, I sent a note to Rockmount, hard by, begging Miss
      Johnston would let her know if there had been heard anything of Lydia&mdash;a
      daughter, once in service with the Johnstons, afterwards in London&mdash;now&mdash;as
      the poor old mother mournfully expressed it&mdash;&ldquo;gone wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, Miss Johnston answered the message in person, and a most
      painful conversation ensued. She is a good woman&mdash;no doubt of that:
      but she is, as Treherne once said of her father, &ldquo;as sharp as a needle and
      as hard as a rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It being already dark, of course I saw her safe back to her own gate. She
      informed me that the family were all quite well, which was the sole
      conversation that passed between us, except concerning the poor dead
      labourer, James Cartwright, and his family, of whom, save Lydia, she spoke
      compassionately, saying they had gone through much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking along by her side, and trying to find a cause for the exceeding
      bitterness and harshness of spirit she had evidenced, it struck me that
      this lady was herself not ignorant of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left her at the gate under the bush of ivy. Through the bars I could
      see, right across the wet garden, the light streaming from the hall-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to bed, and to sleep, if this heart will allow: it has been rather
      unmanageable lately, necessitating careful watching, as will be the case
      till there is nothing here but an empty skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only I could bring this barrack matter to a satisfactory start, from
      which good results might reasonably be expected, I would at once go
      abroad. Anywhere&mdash;it is all the same. A rumour is afloat that we may
      soon get the route for the East, or China; which I could be well content
      with, as my next move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away&mdash;far away; with thousands of miles of tossing sea between me
      and this old England; far away out of all sight or Remembrance. So best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time I call on Widow Cartwright shall be after dark, when, without
      the slightest chance of meeting any one, it will be easy to take a few
      steps further up the village. There is a cranny in one place in the wall,
      whence I know one can get a very good view of the parlour-window, where
      they never close the shutters till quite bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, before our regiment leaves, it will be right I should call&mdash;to
      omit this would hardly be civil, after all the hospitality I have
      received. So I will call some wet day, when they are not likely to be out,&mdash;when,
      probably, the younger sister will be sitting at her books upstairs in the
      attic, which, she told me, she makes her study, and gets out of the way of
      visitors. Perhaps she will not take the trouble to come down. Not even for
      a shake of the hand and a good-bye&mdash;good-bye <i>for ever</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, mother&mdash;unknown mother&mdash;who must have surely loved my father;
      well enough, too, to leave all friends and follow him, a poor lieutenant
      of a marching regiment, up and down the world&mdash;if I had but died with
      you when you brought me into this same troublesome world, how much it
      would have saved!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ust finished my
      long letter to Lisabel, and lingered over the direction, &ldquo;Mrs. Treherne,
      Treherne Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How strange to think of our Lisa as mistress there. Which she is in fact,
      for Lady Treherne, a mild elderly lady, is wholly engrossed in tending Sir
      William, who is very infirm. The old people's rule seems merely nominal&mdash;it
      is Lisabel and Augustus who reign. Their domain is a perfect palace&mdash;and
      what a queen Miss Lis must look therein! How well she will maintain her
      position, and enjoy it too! In her case, are no poetical sufferings from
      haughty parents, delighted to crush a poor daughter-in-law
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;With the burthen of an honour
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Unto which she was not born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Already, they both like her and are proud of her&mdash;which is not
      surprising. I thought I had never seen a more beautiful creature than my
      sister Lisa, when, on her way to Treherne Court, she came home for a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home? I forget, it is not her home now. How strange this must have been to
      her&mdash;if she thought about it. Possibly she did not; being never given
      to sentiment. And, though with us she was not the least altered, it was
      amusing to see how, to everybody else, she appeared quite the married
      lady; even with Mrs. Granton, who, happening to call that day, was
      delighted to see her, and seems not to cherish the smallest resentment in
      the matter of &ldquo;my Colin.&rdquo; Very generous&mdash;for it is not the good old
      lady's first disappointment&mdash;she has been going a-wooing for her son
      ever since he was one-and-twenty, and has not found a daughter-in-law yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin, too, conducted himself with the utmost <i>sangfroid''</i> and when
      Augustus, who is beaming with benevolence to the whole human race, invited
      him to escort his mother, Penelope and me, on our first visit to Treherne
      Court, he accepted the invitation as if it were the pleasantest in the
      world. Truly, if women's hearts are as impressionable as wax, men's are as
      tough as gutta-percha. Talk of breaking them&mdash;faugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope it indicates no barbarity, on my part, if I confess that it would
      have raised my opinion of him, and his sex in general, to have seen Colin
      for a month or so, at least, wholesomely miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel behaved uncommonly well with regard to him, and, indeed, in every
      way. She was as bright as a May morning, and full of the good qualities of
      her Augustus&mdash;whom she really likes very much after her fashion. She
      will doubtless be among the many wives who become extremely attached to
      their husbands, after marriage. To my benighted mind, it has always seemed
      advisable to have a slight preference before that ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me, with a shudder that was altogether natural and undisguised,
      how glad she was that they had been married at once, and that Augustus had
      sold out&mdash;for there is a chance of the regiment's being soon ordered
      on foreign service. I had not heard of this before. It was some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisabel was very affectionate to me the whole day, and, in going away,
      said she hoped I did not miss her much, and that I should get a good
      husband of my own soon; I did not know what a comfort it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody to belong to you&mdash;to care for you&mdash;to pet you&mdash;your
      own personal property in short&mdash;who can't get rid of you, even when
      you're old and ugly. Yes, I'm glad I married poor dear Augustus. And,
      child, I hope to see you married also.. A good little thing like you would
      make a capital wife to somebody. Why, simpleton, I declare she's crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It must have been the over-excitement of this day; but I felt as if, had I
      not cried, my temples and throat would have burst with a choking pain,
      that lasted long after Lisabel was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not altogether stay more than four hours. Augustus talked of
      riding over to the camp, to see his friend, Doctor Urquhart, whom he has
      heard nothing of since the wedding-day; but Lisabel persuaded him against
      it. Men's friendship with one another is worth little, apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope here said she could answer for Doctor Urquhart's being in the
      land of the living, as she had met him a week before at Cartwright's
      cottage, the day the poor old man was killed. Why did she not tell me of
      this? But then she has taken such a prejudice against him, and exults so
      over what she calls his &ldquo;rude behaviour to the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It always seemed to me very foolish to be for ever defending those whose
      character is itself a sufficient defence. If a false word is spoken of a
      friend, one must of course deny it, disprove it. But to be incessantly
      battling with personal prejudice or animosity, I would scorn it! Ay, as
      utterly as I would scorn defending myself under similar attacks. I think,
      in every lesser affection that is worth the name&mdash;the same truth
      holds good&mdash;which I remember being struck with in a play, the only
      play I ever saw acted. The heroine is told by her sister&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;Katherine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      You love this man&mdash;defend him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She answers:&mdash;=.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;You have said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I love him. That's my defence. I'll not
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Assert, in words, the truth on which I've cast
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The stake of life. I love him, and am silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, I think the passage ran thus&mdash;for I cut it out of a
      newspaper afterwards, and long, remembered it. What an age it seems since&mdash;that
      one play, to which Francis took us. And what a strange, dim dream, has
      become the impression it left; something like that I always have in
      reading of Thekla and Max; of love so true and strong&mdash;so perfect in
      its holy strength, that neither parting, grief, nor death, have any power
      over it. Love, which makes you feel that once to have possessed it, must
      be bliss unutterable, unalienable&mdash;better than any happiness or
      prosperity that this world could give&mdash;better than anything in the
      world or out of it, except the love of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sometimes think of this Katherine in this play, when she refuses to let
      her lover barter conscience for life, but when the test comes, says to
      him, herself, &ldquo;No, <i>die!</i>&rdquo; Also, of that scene in Wallenstein, when
      Thekla bids her lover be faithful to his honour and his country, not to
      her&mdash;when, just for one minute, he holds her tight, tight in his arms&mdash;Max,
      I mean. Death, afterwards, could not have been so very hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am beginning to give up&mdash;strange, perhaps, that it should have
      lasted so long&mdash;my belief in the possible happiness of life.
      Apparently, people were never meant to be happy. Small flashes of
      pleasantness come and go; or, it may be that in some few lives, are
      ecstatic moments, such as this I have been thinking of, and then it is all
      over. But many people go plodding along to old age, in a dull, straight
      road, with little sorrow and no joy. Is my life to be such as this?
      Probably. Then the question arises, what am I to do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      It sometimes crosses my mind what Doctor Urquhart said, about his life
      being &ldquo;owed.&rdquo; All our lives are, in one sense: to ourselves, to our
      fellow-creatures, or to God; or, is there some point of union which
      includes all three? If I only could find it out!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, according to Colin Granton's lately learned doctrine&mdash;I know
      whence learned&mdash;it is the having something to do. Something to be,
      your fine preachers of self-culture would suggest; but self-culture is
      often no better than idealised egotism; people sick of themselves want
      something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, driving with papa along the edges of the camp, where we never
      go now, I caught sight of the slope where the hospital is, and could even
      distinguish the poor fellows sitting in the sun, or lounging about in
      their blue hospital clothes. It made me think of Smyrna and Scutari.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; while there is so much misery and sin in the world, a man has no right
      to lull himself to sleep in a paradise of self-improvement and
      self-enjoyment; in which there is but one supreme Adam, one perfect
      specimen of humanity, namely himself. He ought 'to go out and work&mdash;fight,
      if it must be, wherever duty calls him. Nay, even a woman has hardly any
      right, in these days, to sit still and dream. The life of action is nobler
      than the life of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I keep reasoning with myself. If I could only find a good and adequate
      reason for some things which perplex me sorely, about myself and&mdash;other
      people, it would be a great comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, among a heap of notes which papa gave me to make candle-lighters
      of, I found this note, which I kept, the handwriting being peculiar,&mdash;and
      I have a few crotchets about handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Press of business, and other unforeseen circumstances, with which I am
      fettered, make it impossible for me to accept any invitations at present.
      I hope you will believe that I can never forget the hospitalities of
      Rockmount, and that I am ever most gratefully
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your faithful servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Can he, then, mean our acquaintance to cease? Should we be a hindrance in
      his busy, useful life&mdash;such a frivolous family as ours? It may be so.
      Yet I fear papa will be hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon, though it was Sunday, I could not stay in the house or
      garden, but went out, far out upon the moor, and walked till I was weary.
      Then I sat me down upon a heather-bush, all in a heap, my arms clasped
      round my knees, trying to think out this hard question&mdash;what is to
      become of me; what am I to do with my life? It lies before me, apparently
      as bleak, barren and monotonous as these miles of moorland&mdash;stretching
      on and on in dull undulations, or dead flats, till a range of low hills
      ends all! Yet, sometimes, this wild region has looked quite different. I
      remember describing it once&mdash;how beautiful it was, how breezy and
      open, with the ever-changing tints of the moor, the ever-shifting and yet
      always steadfast arch of the sky. Today I found it all colourless, blank,
      and cold; its monotony almost frightened me. I could do nothing but crouch
      on my heather-bush and cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears do one good occasionally. When I dried mine, the hot weight on the
      top of my head seemed lighter. If there had been anybody to lay a cool
      hand there, and say, &ldquo;Poor child, never mind!&rdquo; it might have gone away.
      But there was no one: Lisa was the only one who ever &ldquo;petted&rdquo; me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought, I would go home and write a long letter to Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was rising from my heather-bush, my favourite haunt, being as
      round as a mushroom, as soft as a velvet cushion, and hidden by two great
      furze-bushes, from the road&mdash;I heard footsteps approaching. Having no
      mind to be discovered in that gipsy plight, I crouched down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      People's footsteps are so different, it is often easy to recognize them.
      This, I think, I should have known anywhere&mdash;quick, regular,
      determined; rather hasty, as if no time could be lost; as if, according to
      the proverb, it would never &ldquo;let the grass grow under it.&rdquo; Crouching
      lower, I listened; I heard him stop and speak to an old woman, who had
      been coming up the road towards the village. No words were
      distinguishable, but the voice&mdash;I could not have mistaken it&mdash;it
      is not like our English voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange feeling it is, listening to people's steps or voices, when
      they do not know you are near them. Something like being a ghost, and able
      to watch them&mdash;perhaps watch over them&mdash;without its being
      unnatural or wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood talking&mdash;I should say, Doctor Urquhart stood talking&mdash;for
      several minutes. The other voice, by its querulousness, I guessed to be
      poor Mrs. Cartwright's; but it softened by degrees, and then I heard
      distinctly her earnest &ldquo;thank'ee, Doctor&mdash;God bless'ee, sir,&rdquo; as he
      walked away, and vanished over the slope of the hill. She looked after him
      a minute, and then, turning, toddled on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I overtook her, which was not for some time, she told me the whole
      story of her troubles,&mdash;and how good Doctor Urquhart had been. Also,
      the whole story about her poor daughter&mdash;at least as much as is known
      about it. Mrs. Cartwright thinks she is still somewhere in London, and
      Doctor Urquhart has promised to find her out, if he can. I don't
      understand much about these sort of dreadful things&mdash;Penelope never
      thought it right to tell us: but I can see that what Doctor Urquhart has
      said has given great comfort to the mother of unfortunate Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; said the old woman, with the tears running down, &ldquo;the Doctor's
      been an angel of goodness to me, and there's many a one in these parts as
      can say the same&mdash;though he be only a stranger, here to-day and gone
      to-morrow, as one may say. Eh, dear, it'll be an ill day for many a poor
      body when he goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am glad I saw him&mdash;glad I heard all this. Somehow, hearing of
      things like this makes one feel quieter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not much matter after all&mdash;it does not, indeed! I never
      wanted anybody to think about me, to care for me&mdash;half as much as
      somebody to look up to&mdash;to be satisfied in&mdash;to honour and
      reverence. I can do that&mdash;still!
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a fool, I have been crying again, till I ought, properly, to tear
      this leaf out, and begin again afresh. No, I will not. Nobody will ever
      see it, and it does no harm to any human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless him,&rdquo; the old woman said. I might say something of the like
      sort, too. For he did me a deal of good: he was very kind to me.

      CHAPTER XIII. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>apa and Penelope
      are out to dinner&mdash;I, myself, was out yesterday, and did not return
      till they were gone; so I sit up for them; and, meantime, shall amuse
      myself with writing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last date was Sunday, and now it is only Tuesday, but much seems to
      have happened between. And yet nothing really has happened but two quiet
      days at the Cedars, and one gay evening&mdash;or people would call it gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been the talk of the neighbourhood for weeks&mdash;this amateur
      concert at the camp. We got our invitation, of course. The such and such
      Regiments (I forget which, all but one) presenting their compliments to
      the Reverend William Henry and the Misses Johnston, and requesting their
      company; but papa shook his head, and Penelope was indifferent. Then I
      gave up all idea of going, if I ever had any.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise was almost pleasant when Mrs. Granton, coming in, declared
      she would take me herself, as it was quite necessary I should have a
      little gaiety to keep me from moping after Lisabel. Papa consented, and I
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving along over the moors was pleasant, too&mdash;even though it snowed
      a little. I found myself laughing back at Colin, who sat on the box,
      occasionally turning to shake the white flakes off him like a great Polar
      bear. His kindly, hearty face was quite refreshing to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a habit of growing attached to places, independently of the persons
      connected with them. Thus, I cannot imagine any time when it would not be
      an enjoyment to drive up to the hall-door of the Cedars, sweeping round in
      the wide curve that Colin is so proud of making his carriage-wheels
      describe: to look back up the familiar hill-side, where the winter sun is
      shining on that slope of trees,&mdash;-then run into the house, through
      the billiard-room, and out again by the dining-room windows, on to the
      broad terrace. There, if there is any sunshine, you will be sure to get
      it,&mdash;any wind, it will blow in your face; any bit of colour or
      landscape beauty, you will catch it on this green lawn; the grand old
      cedars&mdash;the distant fir-woods, lying in a still mass of dark blue
      shadow, or standing up, one by one, cut out sharply against the brilliant
      west. Whether it is any meteorological peculiarity I know not; but it
      seems to me as if, whatever the day has been, there is always a fair
      sunset at the Cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the place. If I went away for years&mdash;if I never saw it again&mdash;I
      should always love it and remember it. Mrs. Granton too, for she seems an
      integral part of the picture. Her small, elderly figure, trotting in and
      out of the rooms; her clear loud voice&mdash;she is a little deaf&mdash;along
      the upstairs passages; her perpetual activity&mdash;I think she is never
      quiet but when she is asleep. Above all, her unvarying goodness and
      cheerfulness&mdash;truly the Cedars would not be the Cedars without my
      dear old lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think she ever knew how fond I was of her, even as a little girl.
      Nobody could help it; never anybody had to do with Mrs. Granton without
      becoming fond of her. She is almost the only person living of whom I never
      heard anyone speak an unkind word; because she herself never speaks an ill
      word of any human being. Every one she knows, is &ldquo;the kindest creature,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;the nicest creature,&rdquo; &ldquo;the cleverest creature&rdquo; &mdash;I do believe if you
      presented to her Diabolus himself, she would only call him &ldquo;poor
      creature;&rdquo; would suggest that his temper must have aggravated by the
      unpleasant place he had to live in, and set about some plan for improving
      his complexion, and concealing his horns and tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, I took my favourite seat, where, seen through this greatest of
      the three windows,&mdash;a cedar with its &ldquo;broad, green layers of shade,&rdquo;
       is intersected by a beech&mdash;still faintly yellow&mdash;as I have seen
      it, autumn after autumn, from the same spot. It seemed just like old
      times. I felt happy; as if something pleasant were about to happen, and
      said as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Granton looked delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, my dear, I hope so. And I trust we shall see you here very
      often indeed. Only think, you have never been since the night of the ball.
      What a deal has happened between then and now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had already been thinking the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be curious to any one who, like our Lisa, had married a stranger
      and not an old acquaintance, to analyse afterwards the first impressions
      of a first meeting&mdash;most likely brought about by the merest chance.
      Curious to try and recall the face you then viewed critically, carelessly,
      or with the most absolute indifference&mdash;how it gradually altered and
      altered, till only by a special effort can memory reproduce the pristine
      image, and trace the process by which it has become what it is now&mdash;a
      face by itself, its peculiarities pleasant, its plainnesses sacred, and
      its beauties beautiful above all faces in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the afternoon, Colin was turned out, that is corporeally,
      for his mother talked about him the whole time of his absence, a natural
      weakness rather honourable than pardonable. She has been very long a
      widow, and never had any child but Colin.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our gossip, she asked me if we had seen Doctor Urquhart lately, and
      I said no.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is just like him. Such an odd creature. He will keep away for
      days and weeks, and then turn up as unexpectedly, as he did here
      yesterday. By the by, he inquired after you&mdash;if you were better.
      Colin had told him you were ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I testified my extreme surprise and denial of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you looked ill. You were just like a ghost the day Mrs. Treherne
      was at Rockmount&mdash;my son noticed it ay, you need not flush up so
      angrily&mdash;it was only my Colin's anxiety about you&mdash;he was always
      fond of his old play-fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, and said his old play-fellow was very much obliged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, this business is not so engrossing, but that Doctor Urquhart can find
      time to pay visits somewhere. And he had been inquiring for me. Still he
      might have made the inquiry at our own door. Ought people, even if they do
      lead a busy life, to forget ordinary courtesy&mdash;accepting hospitality,
      and neglecting it&mdash;cultivating acquaintance and then dropping it. I
      think not; all the respect in the world cannot make one put aside one's
      common sense judgment of another's actions. Perhaps the very respect makes
      one more tenacious that no single action should be even questionable. I
      did think, then, and even to-day I have thought sometimes, that Doctor
      Urquhart has been somewhat in the wrong towards us at Rockmount. But as to
      acknowledging it to any of them at home&mdash;never!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Granton discussed him a little, and spoke gratefully of Colin's
      obligations to him, and what a loss it would be for Colin when the
      regiment left the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fortunate that your brother-in-law sold out when he did. He could not
      well have done so now, when there is a report of their being ordered on
      active service shortly. Colin says we are likely to have war again, but I
      do hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just then Colin came to fetch me to the greenhouses to choose a
      camellia for my hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likely to have war again! When Mrs. Granton left me to dress, I sat over
      my bed-room fire, thinking&mdash;I hardly know what. All sorts of visions
      went flitting through my mind&mdash;of scenes I have heard talked about,
      in hospital, in battle, on the battle-field afterwards. Especially one,
      which Augustus has often described, when he woke up, stiff and cold, on
      the moonlight plain, from under his dead horse, and saw Dr. Urquhart
      standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin whistling through the corridor,&mdash;Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granton's lively &ldquo;Are you ready, my dear?&rdquo; made me conscious that this
      would not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up, and dressed myself in the silver-gray silk I wore at the ball;
      I tried to stick the red camellia in my hair, but the buds all broke off
      under my fingers, and I had to go down without it. It was all the same. I
      did not much care. However, Colin insisted on going with a lantern to hunt
      for another flower, and his mother took, a world of pains to fasten it in,
      and make me look &ldquo;pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were so kind&mdash;it was wicked not to try and enjoy one's self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving along in the sharp, clear twilight, till we caught sight of the
      long lines of lamps which make the camp so picturesque at night time, I
      found that compelling one's self to be gay sometimes makes one so.
    </p>
    <p>
      We committed all sorts of blunders in-the k&mdash;came across a sentry who
      challenged us, and, nobody thinking of giving the password, had actually
      levelled his gun, and was proceeding in the gravest manner to do his duty
      and fire upon us&mdash;when our coachman shrieked, and Colin jumped out;
      which he had to do a dozen times, tramping the snow with his thin boots,
      to his mother's great uneasiness&mdash;and laughing all the time&mdash;before
      we discovered the goal of our hopes&mdash;the concert-room. Almost anyone
      else would have grown cross, but this good mother and son have the gayest
      spirits and the best tempers imaginable. The present&mdash;the present is,
      after all, the only thing certain. I began to feel as cheery as they.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giving up our ticket to the most gentlemanly of sergeants, we entered the
      concert-room. Such a blaze of scarlet&mdash;such a stirring of pretty
      heads, between&mdash;such a murmur of merry chat. For the first minute,
      coming out of the dark&mdash;it dazzled me. I grew sick and could see
      nothing: but when we were quietly seated, I looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many of our neighbours and acquaintances whom I knew by sight
      or to bow to&mdash;and that was all. I could see every corner of the room&mdash;still
      that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience seemed in a state of exuberant enjoyment, especially if they
      had a bit of scarlet beside them, which nearly everybody had, except
      ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be quite ashamed of poor Colin in his plain black, Dora, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not very likely&mdash;as I told her, with my heart warmly gratefully to
      Colin, who had been so attentive, thoughtful, and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether a gay and pretty scene. Grave persons might possibly eschew it
      or condemn it&mdash;but no, a large liberal spirit judges all things
      liberally, and would never see evil in anything but sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat&mdash;enjoying all I could. But more than once ghastly imaginations
      intruded&mdash;picturing these young officers otherwhere than here, with
      their merry moustached faces pressed upon the reddened grass, their goodly
      limbs lopped and mangled, or worse, themselves, their kindly, lightsome
      selves, changed into what soldiers are&mdash;must be&mdash;in battle,
      fiends rather than men, bound to execute that slaughter which is the
      absolute necessity of war. To be the slain or the slayer&mdash;which is
      most horrible? To think of a familiar hand&mdash;brother's or husband's&mdash;dropping
      down powerless, nothing but clay; or of clasping, kissing it, returned
      with red blood upon it&mdash;the blood of some one else's husband or
      brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      To have gone on pondering thus would have been dangerous. Happily, I
      stopped myself before all self-control was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first singer was a slim youth, who, facing the footlights with an air
      of fierce determination, and probably more inward cowardice than he would
      have felt towards a regiment of Russians, gave us, in a rather uncertain
      tenor, his resolution to &ldquo;love no more,&rdquo;&mdash;which was vehemently
      applauded&mdash;and vanished. Next came &ldquo;The Chough and Crow,&rdquo; executed
      very independently, none of the vocalists being agreed as to their
      &ldquo;opening day.&rdquo; Afterwards, the first soprano, a professional, informed us
      with shrill expression, that&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, yes, she must have something to
      love,&rdquo;&mdash;which I am sure I hope she had, poor body! There was a duet,
      of some sort, and then the <i>primo tenore</i> came on for an Italian
      song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor youth!&mdash;a fourth-rate opera-singer might have done it better;
      but 'tis mean to criticise: he did his best; and when, after a grand
      roulade, he popped down, with all his heart and lungs, upon the last note,
      there arose a cordial English cheer, to which he responded with an awkward
      duck of the head, and a delighted smile; very unprofessional, but
      altogether pleasant and natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was now half over. Mrs. Granton thought I was looking tired,
      and Colin wrapped my feet up in his fur coat, for it was very cold. They
      were afraid I was not enjoying myself, so I bent my whole appreciative
      faculties to the comical-faced young officer who skipped forward, hugging
      his violin, which he played with such total self-oblivious enjoyment that
      he was the least nervous and the most successful of all the amateurs; the
      timid young officer with the splendid bass voice, who was always losing
      his place and putting his companions out; and the solemn young officer who
      marched up to the piano-forte as if it were a Redan, and pounded away at a
      heavy sonata as if' feeling that England expected him to do his duty;
      which he did, and was deliberately retreating, when, in that free-and-easy
      way with which audience and stage intermingled, some one called him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ansdell, you're wanted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wants me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Urquhart.&rdquo; At least I was almost sure that was the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal more of singing and playing; then &ldquo;God save the
      Queen,&rdquo; with a full chorus and military hand. That grand old tune is
      always exciting; it was so, especially, here to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likely to have war. If so, a year hence, where might be all these gay
      young fellows, whispering and flirting with pretty girls, walked about the
      room by proud mothers and sisters! I never thought of it, never understood
      it, till now&mdash;I who used to ridicule and despise soldiers! These
      mothers&mdash;these sisters!&mdash;they might not have felt it for
      themselves, but my heart felt bursting. I could hardly stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were some time in getting out to the door through the long line of
      epaulets and swords, the owners of which&mdash;I beg their pardon, but
      cannot help saying it&mdash;were not too civil; until a voice behind
      cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do make way there&mdash;how do you expect those ladies to push past you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a courteous helping hand was held out to Mrs. Granton, as any
      gentleman ought to any lady&mdash;especially an old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, is that you? What a scramble this is! Now, will you assist my
      young friend here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;and not till then, I am positive&mdash;he recognised me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something has happened to him&mdash;something has altered him very much. I
      felt certain of that on the very first glimpse I caught of his face. It
      shocked me so that I never said &ldquo;how d'ye do?&rdquo; I never even put out my
      hand. Oh that I had!
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely spoke, and we lost him in the crowd almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great confusion of carriages. Colin ran hither and thither,
      but could not find ours. Some minutes after, we were still out in the
      bitter night; Mrs. Granton talking to somebody, I standing by myself. I
      felt very desolate and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you had that cough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew who it was, and turned round. We shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no business out here on such a night. Why did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, the sharpness did not offend me, though it was rare in Doctor
      Urquhart, who is usually extremely gentle in his way of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him my cough was nothing&mdash;it was indeed as much nervousness as
      cold, though of course I did not confess that&mdash;and then another fit
      came on, leaving me all shaking and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to have come: is there nobody to take better care of you,
      child?&mdash;No&mdash;don't speak. You must submit, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took off a plaid he had about him, and wrapped me up in it, close and
      warm. I resisted a little, and then yielded.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could one do but yield? Protesting again, I was bidden to &ldquo;hold my
      tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind me!&mdash;I am used to all weathers;&mdash;I'm not a little
      delicate creature like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, laughing, I was a great deal stronger than he had any notion of&mdash;but
      as he had begun our acquaintance by taking professional care of me, he
      might just as well continue it; and it certainly was a little colder here
      than it was that night at the Cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Colin came up, to say &ldquo;we had better walk on to meet the carriage,
      rather than wait for it.&rdquo; He and Doctor Urquhart exchanged a few words,
      then he took his mother on one arm&mdash;good Colin, he never neglects his
      old mother&mdash;and offered me the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take care of Miss Theodora,&rdquo; said Doctor Urquhart, rather
      decidedly. &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am sure he meant me to come. I hope it was not rude to Colin, but I
      could not help coming, I could not help taking his arm. It was such a long
      time since we had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I held my tongue, as I had been bidden: indeed, nothing came into my
      head to say. Doctor Urquhart made one only observation, and that not
      particularly striking:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of shoes have you got on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thick ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. You ought not to trifle with your health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why should one be afraid of speaking the truth right out, when a word
      would often save so much of misunderstanding, doubt, and pain? Why should
      one shrink from being the first to say that word, when there is no wrong
      in it, when in all one's heart there is not a feeling that one need be
      ashamed of before any good man or woman, or&mdash;I humbly hope&mdash;before
      God?
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined to speak out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, why have you never been to see us since the wedding? It
      has grieved papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My candour must have surprised him; I felt him start. When he replied, it
      was in that peculiar nervous tone I know so well&mdash;which always seems
      to take away my nervousness, and makes me feel that for the moment I am
      the stronger of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry. I would not on any account grieve your papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come, then, some day this week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I cannot promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A possibility struck me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa is rather peculiar. He vexes people, sometimes, when they are not
      thoroughly acquainted with him. Has he vexed you in any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little hesitation, determined to get at the truth, I asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I vexed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! What an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did seem, at this moment, preposterous, almost absurd. I could have
      laughed at it. I believe I did laugh. Oh, when one has been angry or
      grieved with a friend, and all of a sudden the cloud clears off&mdash;one
      hardly knows how or why, but it certainly is gone, perhaps never existed&mdash;save
      in imagination&mdash;what an infinite relief it is! How cheerful one
      feels, and yet humbled; ashamed, yet inexpressibly content. So glad, so
      satisfied to have only one's self to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked Doctor Urquhart what he had been doing all this while? that I
      understood he had been a good deal engaged; was it about the barrack
      business, and his memorial?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; he said; expressing some surprise at my remembering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I ought not to have referred to it. And yet that is not a fair
      code of friendship. When a friend tells you his affairs, he makes them
      yours, and you have a right to ask about them afterwards. I longed to ask,&mdash;longed
      to know all and everything. For by every carriage-lamp we passed, I saw
      that his face was not as it used to be, that there was on it a settled
      shadow of pain, anxiety&mdash;almost anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have only known Doctor Urquhart three months, yet in those three months
      I have seen him every week, often twice and thrice a-week, and
      owing to the pre-occupation of the rest of the family, almost all his
      society has devolved on me. He and I have often and often sat talking,
      or in &ldquo;playing decorum&rdquo; to Augustus and Lisabel, walked up and down the
      garden together for hours at a time. Also, from my brother-in-law, always
      most open and enthusiastic on the subject, I have heard about Doctor
      Urquhart nearly everything that could be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this will account for my feeling towards him, after so short an
      intimacy, as people usually feel, I suppose, after a friendship of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, something must have happened to make such a change in him.
      It touched me to the quick. Why not, at least, ask the question, which I
      should have asked in a minute of anybody else,&mdash;so simple and natural
      was it.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been quite well since we saw you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&mdash;No, not exactly. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I thought you looked as if you had been ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no. But I have had a great deal of anxious business on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More than that he did not say, nor had I a right to ask. No right! What
      was I, to be wanting rights&mdash;to feel that in some sense I deserved
      them&mdash;that if I had them I should know how to use them. For it is
      next to impossible to be so sorry about one's friends without having also
      some little power to do them good, if they would only give you leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Colin and his mother were running hither and thither in
      search of the carriage, which had disappeared again. As we stood, a blast
      of moorland wind almost took my breath away. Doctor Urquhart turned, and
      wrapped me up closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must be done? You will get your death of cold, and I cannot shelter
      you. Oh, if I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I took courage. There was only a minute more. Perhaps, and the news
      of threatened war darted through my mind like an arrow&mdash;perhaps the
      last minute we might ever be together in all our lives. My life&mdash;I
      did not recollect it just then, but his, busy indeed, yet so wandering,
      solitary, and homeless&mdash;he once told me that ours was the only family
      hearth he had been familiar at for twenty years. No, I am sure it was not
      wrong, either to think what I thought, or to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, I wish you would come to Rockmount. It would do you
      good, and papa good, and all of us; for we are rather dull now Lisabel is
      gone. Do come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited for an answer, but none was given. No excuse, or apology, or even
      polite acknowledgment. Politeness!&mdash;that would have been the sharpest
      unkindness of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they overtook us, and the chance was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin advanced, but Doctor Urquhart put me into the carriage himself, and
      as Colin was restoring the plaid, said rather irritably:&mdash;&ldquo;No, no,
      let her wrap herself in it, going home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not another word passed between us, except that, as I remembered
      afterwards, just before they came up, he had said, &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; hastily
      adding to it, &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some people's words&mdash;people who usually express very little&mdash;rest
      in one's mind strangely. Why should he say &ldquo;God bless you?&rdquo; Why did he
      call me &ldquo;child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sent back his plaid by Colin next morning, with a message of thanks, and
      that &ldquo;it had kept me very warm.&rdquo; I wonder if I shall ever see Doctor
      Urquhart again?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it is not the seeing one's friends, the having them within reach,
      the hearing of and from them, which makes them ours&mdash;many a one has
      all that, and yet has nothing. It is the believing in them, the depending
      on them; assured that they are true and good to the core, and therefore
      could not but be good and true towards everybody else &mdash;ourselves
      included. Ay, whether we deserve it or not. It is not our deserts which
      are in question, but their goodness, which, once settled, the rest follows
      as a matter of course. They would be untrue to themselves if they were
      insincere or untrue to us. I have half-a-dozen friends, living within
      half-a-dozen miles, whom I feel further off from than I should from Doctor
      Urquhart if he lived at the Antipodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never uses words lightly. He never would have said &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; if
      he had not specially wished God to bless me&mdash;poor me! a foolish,
      ignorant, thoughtless child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a child&mdash;not a bit better nor wiser than a child: full of all
      binds of childish naughtinesses, angers, petulances, doubts&mdash;oh, if I
      knew he was at this minute sitting in our parlour, and I could run down
      and sit beside him, tell him all the hard things I have been thinking of
      him of late, and beg his pardon; asking him to be a faithful friend to me,
      and help me to grow into a better woman than I am ever likely to become&mdash;what
      an unutterable comfort it would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      A word or two more about my pleasant morning at the Cedars, and then I
      must close my desk and see that the study-fire is all right&mdash;papa
      likes a good fire when he comes home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they are! what a loud ring! it made me jump from my chair. This must
      be finished to-morrow, when&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
